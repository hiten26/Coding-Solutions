exide technologies s.r.l.,California Department of Toxic Substances Control Intervenes After Exide Fails to Fully Investigate Contamination,"SACRAMENTO, California, July 19 -- The California Department of Toxic Substances Control issued the following news release:
* * *
- DTSC will complete investigation detailing extent of contamination from former battery recycling facility as work continues on cleanup of lead-impacted properties
* * *
Citing persistent refusal by Exide Technologies to comply with its legal obligation to investigate the extent of contamination around its former battery recycling facility, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control today rejected Exide's Draft Residential RCRA Facility Investigation Report (RFI) and Residential Corrective Measures Study. DTSC also assessed penalties for violating administrative orders.
""Exide has a moral and legal responsibility to the children and families who live in the area affected by this contamination,"" DTSC Acting Director Meredith Williams said. ""Exide is once again trying to get out of performing its duty to investigate.""
In the report, Exide concluded, without support, that it is not responsible for the contamination in the residential areas surrounding its former lead-acid battery recycling facility in Vernon, California. Exide based its Residential Corrective Measures Study on its Draft Residential RFI Report, which DTSC rejected, and again concluded that it is not obligated to clean up any contamination in the residential areas. Exide attempted to rely on several unjustified assumptions to walk away from its legal obligations.
Since Exide's report fails to protect public health, safety and the environment, DTSC will now complete the investigation and modify the report. Exide will be responsible for DTSC's investigation and report modification costs.
""Exide has refused to conduct its investigation in accordance with California law, and has used flawed assumptions to justify walking away from this obligation,"" said Grant Cope, Acting Deputy Director of DTSC's Site Mitigation and Restoration Program. ""DTSC will complete an investigation that protects the health of the people who live and work near the facility.""
Exide's legal obligations to investigate the nature and extent of its contamination are set forth in the Corrective Action Consent Order entered into by Exide and DTSC in 2002 and a 2014 Stipulation and Order, as amended in 2015 and 2016.
DTSC found that Exide committed 24 violations of the orders, and DTSC assessed $240,000 in stipulated penalties against Exide for these violations. Because Exide's failure to investigate the extent of its contamination in the residential areas may also violate requirements of California's Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL), DTSC may seek additional penalties for these statutory violations. Each violation of the HWCL is subject to a maximum penalty of $70,000 per day.
DTSC has also asked the United States Attorney's Office to end its Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) with Exide. The NPA provided that if Exide complied with the material obligations of the agreement, including a requirement to comply with DTSC's orders, the U.S. Attorney's Office would not prosecute Exide or its agents for any alleged violation of federal criminal laws relating to the illegal storage, disposal, shipment, and transportation of hazardous waste related to its past operations at the Vernon facility. DTSC finds that the deficiencies of the RFI report, despite clear direction from DTSC, constitute a failure to meet the terms of DTSC's orders and are grounds for revocation of the NPA.
Links to Exide's Draft RFI Report, DTSC's response letters, and other background information:
* Exide's Draft Residential RCRA Facility Investigation Report (includes Report, DTSC Letters, NPA Termination request)
* Residential Corrective Measures Study (includes Report, DTSC Letter, NPA Termination request)
* 2002 Corrective Action Consent Order
* 2014 Stipulation and Order and Amendments
* Exide's Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States Attorney's Office
Background
DTSC is cleaning up lead-contaminated soil at residential properties, schools, parks, day care centers, and child care facilities with the highest levels of lead in soil and the greatest risk of exposure within a 1.7-mile radius surrounding the former Exide Technologies, Inc., battery recycling facility in Vernon. DTSC's top priority is protecting the health and safety of people in the community, especially the youngest and most vulnerable.
As of July 12, 2019, 1,008 parcels, out of the 8,555 parcels that have allowed DTSC access to conduct soil sampling, have been cleaned.
The Exide Technologies facility at 2700 S. Indiana St. in Vernon recycled lead from used automotive batteries and other sources. The Vernon plant typically recycled about 11 million batteries annually. The facility closed in 2015.

air india limited,Deepak Talwar probe: ED attaches Rs 120-crore Aerocity hotel,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has provisionally attached the Holiday Inn hotel in Aerocity near the IGI Airport in Delhi in connection with its money laundering probe against corporate consultant Deepak Talwar.
The ED has alleged that Talwar received over Rs 272 crore as kickbacks for pushing several deals in the aviation sector in India. This money, the ED has claimed, was routed through several shell companies floated by Talwar, and used to buy the hotel, which is valued at over Rs 120 crore.
The hotel, however, said on Saturday evening that it was ""fully operational"". Asked for a comment, Parisa Chum, Director Communications, India, Middle East and Africa, InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG), said: ""We not privy to the details of the case so we cannot comment on it. The hotel is fully operational at the moment."" An order of provisional attachment, which is issued by the Director of the ED, has no impact on the ground until it is confirmed by the adjudicating authority. The confirmation has to come within 90 days, following which the owner of the property can be deprived of the use of the property. The adjudicating authority's order can be challenged in the High Court.
Talwar, who was recently deported from the UAE, is under investigation by the CBI and ED for his alleged role as the key middleman in the purchase of 111 aircraft by the erstwhile state-owned domestic carrier Indian Airlines from Airbus and Boeing during the UPA regime.
The CBI and ED have filed four separate FIRs in connection with these purchases, the 2011 merger of Air India with Indian Airlines, and the ceding of profitable routes and timings in favour of foreign airlines that led to massive losses to the national airline.
The ED, which is probing the case based on an FIR registered by the CBI in 2017, has arraigned officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the National Aviation Company of India Limited (NACIL), Air India, and unknown private persons as accused. NACIL was formed to oversee the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines, and was renamed Air India Limited in 2010.
""It has been revealed that accused Deepak Talwar illegally engaged in liaisoning/lobbying with politicians, ministers, other public servants and officials of Ministry of Civil Aviation for airlines such as Emirates, Air Arabia and Qatar Airways for securing undue benefits for them. He illegally managed to secure favourable traffic rights for these airlines during 2008-09 at the cost of National carrier, Air India,"" the ED has said in a statement.
According to the ED, its investigations have revealed that in lieu of securing favourable traffic rights, these airlines made payments to the tune of Rs 272 crore to Talwar during 2008-09.
On February 13, The Indian Express reported that three years after Indian Airlines signed a deal to purchase 43 aircraft from Airbus, the French aircraft manufacturer incorporated a company in partnership with Deepak Talwar, and transferred $10.5 million to its accounts. Talwar's son Aditya is one of the directors of the Singapore-based company.
The payments were made in two tranches of $ 4.5 million and $ 6 million to Auctus Capital PTE Ltd in 2012, three years after the company was incorporated, and almost six years after the deal between Indian Airlines and Airbus was signed.
The ED has claimed that its probe has revealed that Talwar created a web of entities, owned by him and members of his family, in India and offshore havens, to launder the Rs 272 crore received from the foreign airlines.
""Part of these payments were made to a bank account in Bank of Singapore, belonging to a company M/s Asiafield Limited registered in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially owned by Deepak Talwar. These Proceeds of Crime were layered through a series of international money transfers, to finally integrate in India in M/s Wave Hospitality Private Limited, a company beneficially owned and controlled by Deepak Talwar and his family members in the name of his son, Aditya Talwar. These Proceeds of Crime were then utilized in the construction of Hotel Holiday Inn in Aerocity, New Delhi,"" the ED statement said.
Deepak Talwar had fled the country in 2017 to avoid the investigation. However, he was deported by the immigration authority of Dubai on January 31 this year, and was arrested by the ED under The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002. He is in judicial custody at present.
Talwar's lawyer Tanvir Ahmed Mir has earlier denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, and said Talwar had nothing to do with any of the companies mentioned by the ED.
""The ED is indulging in kite-flying. I deny any kind of payment made to Mr Talwar directly or indirectly. Without any confirmation from Airbus obtained through issuance of a letter rogatory, it is sinful to accuse my client and defame him in public domain. Mr Aditya Talwar has no concern with Airbus or any of these deals. He is not a beneficiary.""
Airbus had earlier told The Indian Express: ""We do not comment on any ongoing investigation. We have cooperated with the Indian authorities in the past and will continue to do so.",1
kpmg llp,UPDATE: Former regulator met privately with KPMG while firm was under scrutiny,"PCAOB's Franzel, now an EY adviser, privately coached KPMG on responding to regulator questions about quality
improvement efforts

  A former audit-industry regulator who advises one of the largest firms on audit quality was also one of two board
members willing to meet privately in 2015 and 2016 with KPMG LLP, which was under significant scrutiny by the regulator
because of chronically poor audit inspection results.

  Former Public Company Accounting Oversight Board member Jay Hanson testified in March during the trial of David
Middendorf, the former KPMG National Managing Partner of Audit Quality, that Jeanette Franzel, another board member, was
his companion for pre-board meetings with KPMG beginning in 2015, while the firm was being heavily monitored for its
high number of inspection discrepancies.

  Middendorf was on trial with Jeffrey Wada, a former PCAOB inspector, for using audit inspection data stolen from the
regulator by Wada.

  Hanson, testifying in Middendorf's defense, told the court that sometime after he started with the PCAOB board in
2011, he was approached by a member of leadership of another firm with a request to meet prior to the firm's biannual
scheduled meeting with his board colleagues to share his personal views on what he thought was ""most important to get
out of the meeting.""

  After having several meetings like that with other firms, he made it known to all the firms that he was willing to
talk with them before the meeting, via a phone call or personal meeting, and KPMG decided to take him up on that offer
in 2015.

  Hanson's testimony about Franzel's participation in meetings with KPMG was consistent with that of Middendorf and
Thomas Whittle, the former KPMG national partner-in-charge for inspections, who said Hanson was accompanied to pre-board
meetings with KPMG leadership by another PCAOB board member. He testified that it was general guidance at the regulator
that for meetings between board members and audit firm leadership of any kind, it was advisable to have another board
member or staff representative of the PCAOB accompany the board member.

the-kpmg-cheating-scandal-was-much-more-widespread-than-originally-thought-2019-06-18)

  Franzel said in a statement to MarketWatch, ""My purpose in attending any pre-board meetings with firm personnel was to
convey my personal views and concerns related to the state of audit quality and affirm their commitment to making
improvements to audit quality.""

  Franzel is one of three people appointed to a panel by EY in January (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/former-board-
member-of-audit-regulator-to-join-ey-advisory-board-raising-conflict-questions-2019-02-05), after a one-year cooling off
period for ""practicing"" before the PCAOB expired. The objective of the EY panel is to get an outside perspective on
aspects of its operations, culture or strategy that relate to audit quality. Franzel left the PCAOB in January 2018
shortly before the SEC and Justice Department filed civil and criminal charges against the former KPMG partners and ex-
PCAOB professional for the regulatory data theft.

  A spokesman for EY told MarketWatch, ""We are delighted that Jeanette Franzel is a member of EY's Independent Audit
Quality Committee. Throughout her distinguished career in public service, and as a certified public accountant, Ms.
Franzel has consistently demonstrated the highest levels of professionalism and integrity. Her insights and experience
are of great value to EY as we deliver on our commitment to the highest quality in audits. EY and Ms. Franzel are aware
of the ethical requirements resulting from her role as a former PCAOB Board member, and we are confident of her and our
ongoing compliance with those obligations.""

  The Securities and Exchange Commission fined KPMG $50 million in mid-June for using stolen PCAOB inspection
information to cheat on audit inspections. Five former KPMG officials -- Middendorf, Thomas Whittle, and David Britt,
along with Brian Sweet and Cynthia Holder who came to KPMG from the PCAOB and one former PCAOB official, Wada -- were
charged last year in the case alleging they schemed to interfere with the PCAOB's ability to detect audit quality
violations at KPMG.

  Whittle changed his plea from not guilty to guilty on all five counts last October and agreed to cooperate with the
prosecutors. Whittle, Middendorf and Sweet are all now awaiting sentencing. Cynthia Holder also pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to eight months  (https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-pcaob-inspections-leader-and-kpmg-executive-
director-sentenced-scheme-steal)in prison last Friday. Former KPMG banking partner David Britt is pending trial.

convicted-in-steal-the-exam-scheme-2019-03-11)

  The SEC revealed a much larger scandal at KPMG when it fined the firm in June. KPMG auditors, including some senior
partners in charge of public company audits, cheated on internal tests related to ethics, integrity and compliance
training that had been mandated by a 2017 SEC enforcement action against the firm. In addition, for a period of time up
to November 2015, some audit professionals, including one partner, manipulated the system for their exams to lower the
scores required to pass.

occidental petroleum corp,Gota buys more time to respond to Ahimsa's complaint [Sri Lanka Sunday Observer],"Sri Lanka, May 12 -- Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa has petitioned the US District Court of Central California through his lawyers for a further extension to respond charges set out in a civil lawsuit filed by Ahimsa Wickrematunge accusing him of instigating and authorising the murder of her father and founder Editor of The Sunday Leader, Lasantha Wickrematunge.
On April 29, attorney John C. Ulin, a senior partner at the Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer law firm headquartered in Washington DC, filed an ""unopposed application"" to extend time to respond to the initial complaint filed by Lasantha Wickrematunge's 27 year old daughter.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa's lawyers have proposed a new response date of June 27, 2019, as a deadline to respond to the complaint in their April 29 application to court.
Agreement has been reached between Ahimsa Wickrematunge's legal team to give Rajapaksa, the defendant in the case, a total of 60 days additional time from the original response date to respond to the complaint by the daughter of the slain journalist.
The application has been made in order to give Rajapaksa sufficient time to prepare expert testimony and collect additional evidence necessary to support a motion to dismiss, his lawyers submitted to court in documents seen by Sunday Observer.
In her complaint filed on April 4, Ahimsa Wickrematunge alleged that ""Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a United States citizen and Sri Lanka's then Secretary of Defence, instigated and authorised the extra-judicial killing of Lasantha"" and ""had responsibility over those who executed the assassination.""
The case has been filed under the US Torture Victims Protection Act and the Alien Tort Statute, legislation that allows aggrieved persons to file suit in the United States for human rights abuses committed in foreign jurisdictions. The laws stipulate that notice must be served on a defendant while on US soil. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was served notice on April 7, 2019 in the parking lot of the Trader Joe's Supermarket in his hometown of Los Angeles.
The former Defence Secretary's motion to dismiss Ahimsa Wickrematunge's civil lawsuit will be based on forum non conveniens grounds, Gotabaya Rajapaksa's US legal team reveals in the application, referring to a legal doctrine that a court may refuse to hear a case on the basis that a more appropriate forum to hear the case is available to parties.
""A party moving to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds ""bears the burden of demonstrating an adequate alternative forum, and that the balance of private and public interest factors favors dismissal."" Cariajano v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., 626 F.3d 1137, 1145 (9th Cir. 2010),"" the application by the former Defence Secretary's lawyers states.
""Consequently, Defendant requires the additional time to prepare expert testimony, potentially conduct depositions, and collect other evidence necessary to meet its burden at the motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, motions to dismiss premised on forum non conveniens frequently rely upon sworn declaration and deposition testimony to establish the existence of an adequate alternative forum.""
Since Rajapaksa resides in Sri Lanka, a country in a time zone over 12 hours ahead of California, making coordination and communication between Defendant and his US counsel often slow and time consuming, his lawyers submitted to court.
""This request for additional time will give effect to the agreement of the parties and will allow Defendant time to coordinate with counsel and prepare his response to the Complaint, which will ultimately help this Court adjudicate the matter,"" the application by Gotabaya Rajapaksa's lawyers noted.

patisserie holdings plc,"Five arrested over alleged fraud at Solihull-based Patisserie Valerie [Governance, Risk & Compliance Monitor Worldwide]","FIVE people have been arrested over alleged accounting fraud at the Solihull-based Patisserie Valerie chain, the Serious Fraud Office has said.
The arrests took place last Tuesday, June 18, in a joint operation with police, the SFO said.
It comes eight months after the firms former finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested and has been released on bail.
Patisserie Valerie owned by Hall Green-based Patisserie Holdings plc with its headqaurters on Sarehole Road went into administration in January and was bought for 5million by Causeway Capital.
It was put up for sale after collapsing following the discovery of allegedly fraudulent activity in its accounts.
Around 70 cafes closed across the country including Druckers in Touchwood Shopping Centre in January.
The move resulted in some 920 redundancies across the country.
An SFO spokesperson, who did not say who had been arrested or what they were detained for, said: On Tuesday, June 18, as part of a joint operation with Hertfordshire, Leicestershire and the Metropolitan Police Services, five individuals were arrested and interviewed in connection with the Serious Fraud Office investigation into individuals associated with Patisserie Holdings PLC.",1

PINNACLE BANK, et al.,. | United States Courts Opinions: United States District Court Western District of KANSAS : REZAC LIVESTOCK COMMISSION CO., INC., Plaintiff, Case No. 15-4958-DDC-KGS v. PINNACLE BANK, et al.,.","Washington: United States District Court Western District of KANSAShas issued the following order:
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSASREZAC LIVESTOCK COMMISSION CO., INC., Plaintiff, Case No.15-4958-DDC-KGS v. PINNACLE BANK, et al., Defendants. MEMORANDUM ANDORDER This case originated from a substantial cattle transaction gonewrong. In simplest terms, plaintiff sold a million dollars' worthof cattle to an individual who didn't make good on his promise topay. When plaintiff learned that the buyer's check wouldn'tclear, it was too late to recover the cattle. So, plaintiff was out thecattle and didn't receive the payment it was promised. Sensing thatit was unlikely to recover against the defaulting cattle buyer,plaintiff has sued two defendants. The first is Pinnacle Bank, the bankof the defaulting cattle buyer. The second defendant is Dinsdale Bros.,Inc., the company who purchased the cattle from the individual whodefaulted on his promise to pay plaintiff. After spirited discovery andmotion practice, all three parties moved for summary judgment. See Docs.102, 104, & 110. In a Memorandum and Order entered late last year,the court decided all three motions. See Doc. 125 (entered December 21,2018). The court denied plaintiff's summary judgment motion in itsentirety. Defendant Pinnacle's motion met the same fate. Theultimate purchaser of the cattle--Dinsdale--fared slightly better. Thecourt granted Dinsdale's summary judgment motion againstplaintiff's claim for breach of contract, but denied the rest ofthe motion. Altogether, these rulings meant that plaintiff's claimsfor conversion, civil Case 5:15-cv-04958-DDC Document 157 Filed 06/26/19Page 1 of 30 2 conspiracy, and unjust enrichment against both defendantswould proceed to trial. Plaintiff's claim against Pinnacle forunjust enrichment also survived for trial. Fourteen days after thesummary judgment Order issued, Pinnacle Bank filed a Motion toReconsider. See Doc. 127. This motion asked the court to reconsider itssummary judgment ruling on the conversion claim against the bank.Plaintiff responded. See Doc. 131. Concluding that Pinnacle'sreconsideration motion raised substantial legal questions, the courtinvited the parties to present oral argument. See Docs. 130 & 133.On February 1, 2019, counsel thoughtfully argued the difficult issuesthat inhere in the conversion claims. Pinnacle's argumentspersuaded the court that it was a mistake to begin the trial with suchsubstantial legal questions remaining unresolved. So, the court vacatedthe approaching trial date on its own motion. See Doc. 146. Whilepreparing for the February 1 oral argument on the reconsiderationmotion, the court encountered a statute that the summary judgment briefshadn't discussed, at least not in any detail: Kan. Stat. Ann. SS84-4-303, part of the Uniform Commercial Code (""UCC""), asadopted in Kansas. To be fair, Pinnacle had cited UCC SS 4-303 tosupport the proposition that a bank may ""honor checks in anyorder."" Doc. 105 at 19 n.1 (Pinnacle's brief supporting itssummary judgment motion). And, plaintiff's Reply cited that portionof Pinnacle's motion and the UCC provision, arguing that Pinnaclehad ""concede[d] it could have honored the checks in anyorder."" Doc. 121 at 27. But, that was the extent of the discussion.And neither party cited the Kansas version of the statute, any of theUCC Comments, or the Kansas Comments. And, most of all, Pinnacle neverargued that UCC SS 4-303 supplanted the Kansas conversion casespredating the statute's enactment in Kansas. Three things aboutKan. Stat. Ann. SS 84-4-303 captured the court's attention. Case5:15-cv-04958-DDC Document 157 Filed 06/26/19 Page 2 of 30 3 First, thisprovision asserts that it governs a bank's ""right or duty topay an item or to charge its customer's account for the item""when presented to a bank for payment. Kan. Stat. Ann. SS 84-4-303(a).These rights and duties are at the heart of plaintiff's conversionclaim against Pinnacle. Second, the UCC Comments for SS 4-303 providehelpful commentary about this provision's role in the UCC'sbroader regulation of banks, checks, and other commercial paper. Onepart of this commentary states the obvious: A person who writes checks""should have funds available to meet all of them . . . ."" Kan.Stat. Ann. SS 84-4-303 UCC cmt. 7. The Comment continues with guidancethat is directly pertinent to this dispute. The ""drawer"" ofthe check-- here, Charles Leonard, the person who purchased the cattlefrom plaintiff but defaulted on his duty to pay for them--""has nobasis for urging one [check] should be paid before another."" Id.And, the Comment concludes with the most salient point of all:""[T]he holders [of checks] have no direct right against the payorbank in any event"" unless that bank has ""accepted, certified,or finally paid a particular item, or has become liable for it underSection 4-302."" Id. In this case, plaintiff is the""holder"" of the relevant check. Plaintiff held the checkissued by the defaulting buyer, Mr. Leonard, on his checking accountwith Pinnacle--the ""payor bank"" referenced in the Comment.Third, timing matters. Kansas adopted SS 84-4-303 in 1991. Thisprovision thus postdates almost all the case authorities that theparties had relied on in their summary judgment papers. The priorversion of the statute--enacted in 1966--contains almost identicalprovis

mitsubishi ufj financial group inc,EU fines five banks for currency rigging,"EU fines five banks for currency riggingEU fines five banks for currency riggingOn May 16th European Commission slapped a collective fine of about EUR1.1bn (US$1.2bn) on five banks for forming a currency market cartel following the 2008 financial crisis. The fine has been levied on US-based JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, UK's Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and Barclays Plc, and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG). JPMorgan and RBS reportedly acknowledged the conclusion of the case, whereas Barclays declined to comment to media outlets. Statements from MUFG and Citigroup were not available.  The regulator alleged that the banks had formed two cartels: the ""Forex-Three Way Banana Split"" cartel ran from December 2007 to January 2013, whereas the ""Forex-Essex Express"" cartel ran for nearly three years from December 2009. These cartels were involved in rigging 11 currencies, including the Euro, Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The commission did not impose any fines on UBS Group AG as the Swiss lender had disclosed the presence of the cartels, which led to the commencement of a probe in 2013.The commission noted that some traders had exchanged sensitive information and trading plans, such as prices for specific transactions and outstanding customer orders. These traders also synchronised their trading strategies through online chat rooms. The regulator claimed that the coordination between these traders had helped them make trading decisions.",1
bank of beirut s.a.l.,Jammal Trust Bank of Lebanon Is Hit With US Sanctions After Similar Civil Lawsuit in EDNY,"Jammal Trust Bank of Lebanon Is Hit With US Sanctions And Pompeo Speaks After Earlier Lawsuit in EDNY
By Matthew Russell Lee, CJR PFT CEFC Video
SDNY & UN GATE, August 29 - Back on January 8 while reporting from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Inner City Press noted that  Riad Salameh, Governor of the Banque Centrale du Liban (BDL), said that a civil lawsuit by approximately 1,200 plaintiffs has been brought against 11 Lebanese banks for assisting Hezbollah. The plaintiffs, all US citizens, filed the lawsuit in court in New York. The defendants in the lawsuit include the following banks, including now sanctioned Jammal Trust Bank and Bank Audi 2. Bank of Beirut 3. Bank of Beirut And The Arab Countries (BBAC)  4. Banque Libano-Française (BLF)  5. BLOM Bank  6. Byblos Bank 7. Fransabank...  9. Lebanon And Gulf Bank (LGB) 10. Middle East Africa Bank (MEAB) 11. SGBL.
Now on August 29 the US has hit Jammal Trust Bank with sanctions over alleged support of Hezbollah, senior administration official said on a White House conference call. One of the officials said that Jammal Trust Bank knowingly provided support to Hezbollah. ""It's role as Hezbollah's bank of choice is prominent... Jammal Trust has knowingly provided financial services to Hezbollah's financial counsel and U.S. entities affiliated with Hezbollah.""
After the call, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ""The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned today Lebanon-based Jammal Trust Bank SAL (Jammal Trust) for supporting Hizballah’s illicit financial and banking activities.  Jammal Trust has a longstanding relationship with a key Hizballah financial entity and provides financial services to the Martyrs Foundation and companies controlled by Hizballah’s Executive Council.  Jammal Trust’s misconduct undermines the integrity of the Lebanese financial system.  Today’s designation reflects our determination to counter Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities in Lebanon.  We will continue to target individuals and entities involved in financing and providing support to Hizballah while working closely with the Central Bank of Lebanon and other Lebanese institutions which work to preserve the integrity and stability of Lebanon’s banking system."" We'll have more on this, including if and how it impacts the civil case.
The multi-bank civil action was brought on January 1 2019, under the Anti Terrorism Act by American nationals who were injured, and by the estates and families of American nationals who were killed or injured, by reason of acts of international terrorism in Iraq between 2004 and 2011 that were committed, planned or authorized by the United States designated Foreign Terrorist Organization... The EDNY case involves Mozambique and its former finance minster working with Credit Suisse, a member of Guterres' UN Global Compact, to defraud the people of that country. Three former Credit Suisse bankers were arrested in London yesterday on US charges that they took part in a fraud scheme involving US$2 billion in loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique: Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37. The three were charged in an indictment in  the EDNY Brooklyn, New York federal court with conspiring to violate the FCPA and to commit money laundering and securities fraud, according to spokesperson John Marzulli. Former Mozambique Finance Minister Manuel Chang was arrested in South Africa as part of the same criminal case.  A fifth man, Jean Boustani, was arrested on Wednesday at New York's John F Kennedy Airport. Boustani is a Lebanese citizen who worked for an Abu Dhabi-based contractor of the Mozambican companies. ""The indictment alleges that the former employees worked to defeat the bank’s internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement. When the guarantees were revealed in 2016, foreign donors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cut off support for Mozambique. Inner City Press inside the UN asked Mozambique diplomats about it - until it was without due process ousted from the UN, which it has now applied to reverse.",1

bar harbor bank and trust,Bar Harbor bank added to lawsuit against former lawmaker who stole elderly widow's trust funds,"Jun. 11--The heirs of a Belfast woman whose estate was raided by a former Maine legislator have expanded a lawsuit against the estate's trustee to include the bank where the trust funds were set up. The expansion is part of an effort to recover more of the $3 million that vanished from the estate of Phyllis Poor from a long-term theft that landed the trustee, 54-year-old Robert Kenneth Lindell Jr., in prison for 10 years.
Attorneys Sarah Irving Gilbert and Christopher MacLean of Camden allege in a new filing in Maine Business and Consumer Court in Portland that Bar Harbor Trust Services, a division of Bar Harbor Bank and Trust, did not properly oversee the activities of Lindell, the estate's trustee who was convicted of theft and tax evasion in November. The attorneys also allege that once Bar Harbor Trust Services learned that Lindell was suspected of stealing from Poor's estate, employees tried to cover up what had happened.
They are seeking punitive damages from the Bar Harbor-based bank.
In August, Gilbert and MacLean won a $3 million pre-judgment attachment on Lindell's real estate and personal property. The attachment prevented Lindell, formerly of Frankfort and Cloverdale, California, from selling his real estate holdings or personal property before repaying the stolen money.
Jurors found that Lindell drained more than $3 million from Poor's estate between 2013 and 2017. Poor died in 2012 at the age of 92.
As the trustee of Poor's estate, Lindell had access to two trust funds. Those funds were set up with Bar Har Trust Services, which, according to the lawsuit, should have paid closer attention to how much money Lindell was withdrawing.
The amended complaint accuses the bank's trust division of fraud, negligence, conspiracy, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other activities that weren't in the interest of Poor's heirs.
""This financial institution was asleep at the wheel,"" Gilbert said last week. ""For years it allowed [Lindell] to take money from Mrs. Poor's estate.""
Eric Wycoff, the Portland attorney who represents the bank, on Friday described the claims as ""meritless."" The bank has asked the judge to dismiss them from the lawsuit.
""Bar Harbor Trust Services feels very strongly that it has at all times acted appropriately, not done anything wrong, and that the claims contained in the second amended complaint against it are meritless,"" Wycoff said.
Poor's estate was valued at nearly $6.7 million when she died, the complaint said. During Lindell's criminal trial, the estate should have been valued at $5.5 million.
It was to be divided into thirds to be distributed equally among a trust for Poor's son, Frederick J. Poor, a disabled Vietnam veteran who lives in Florida; a trust for her grandchildren; and money for Waldo County charities. Her will stated that she and her husband had provided for their other children during their lifetimes so they were not included in the will.
Bar Harbor Trust Services no longer is overseeing the trusts, according to Gilbert.
She also said that while a substantial amount of money has been collected from Lindell's real estate holdings and personal property, Poor's heirs have not been made whole. If the judge finds Bar Harbor Trust Services did not properly oversee Lindell's activities, he could order the bank to repay a portion of the money Lindell stole.
In sending Lindell to prison for 10 years, the maximum sentence for theft in Maine, Superior Court Justice William Anderson in April described his conduct as ""outrageous.""
The judge said that Lindell wrote checks from the trust accounts to support his ""lavish lifestyle,"" including the purchase and renovation of a house in California wine country, and credit card bills for expensive travel and dining in the U.S. and Europe. He also paid for his child's private high school and college tuition with stolen funds.
Anderson ordered Lindell to pay $750,000 in restitution to the Poor trusts and a second victim who lives in France. The judge based that amount on what he estimated Lindell could afford.
Gilbert said that amount is included in the $3 million pre-judgment attachment.
Lindell served in the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican from 2004 to 2006, when he was defeated in his re-election bid.
A hearing on Bar Harbor Trust Services' motion to dismiss has not been set.",1

One of the officials said that Jammal Trust Bank knowingly provided support to Hezbollah. ""It's role as Hezbollah's bank of choice is prominent... Jammal Trust has knowingly provided financial services to Hezbollah's financial counsel and U.S. entities affiliated with Hezbollah.""
After the call, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ""The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned today Lebanon-based Jammal Trust Bank SAL (Jammal Trust) for supporting Hizballah’s illicit financial and banking activities.  Jammal Trust has a longstanding relationship with a key Hizballah financial entity and provides financial services to the Martyrs Foundation and companies controlled by Hizballah’s Executive Council.  Jammal Trust’s misconduct undermines the integrity of the Lebanese financial system.  Today’s designation reflects our determination to counter Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities in Lebanon.  We will continue to target individuals and entities involved in financing and providing support to Hizballah while working closely with the Central Bank of Lebanon and other Lebanese institutions which work to preserve the integrity and stability of Lebanon’s banking system."" We'll have more on this, including if and how it impacts the civil case.
The multi-bank civil action was brought on January 1 2019, under the Anti Terrorism Act by American nationals who were injured, and by the estates and families of American nationals who were killed or injured, by reason of acts of international terrorism in Iraq between 2004 and 2011 that were committed, planned or authorized by the United States designated Foreign Terrorist Organization... The EDNY case involves Mozambique and its former finance minster working with Credit Suisse, a member of Guterres' UN Global Compact, to defraud the people of that country. Three former Credit Suisse bankers were arrested in London yesterday on US charges that they took part in a fraud scheme involving US$2 billion in loans to state-owned companies in Mozambique: Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37. The three were charged in an indictment in  the EDNY Brooklyn, New York federal court with conspiring to violate the FCPA and to commit money laundering and securities fraud, according to spokesperson John Marzulli. Former Mozambique Finance Minister Manuel Chang was arrested in South Africa as part of the same criminal case.  A fifth man, Jean Boustani, was arrested on Wednesday at New York's John F Kennedy Airport. Boustani is a Lebanese citizen who worked for an Abu Dhabi-based contractor of the Mozambican companies. ""The indictment alleges that the former employees worked to defeat the bank’s internal controls, acted out of a motive of personal profit, and sought to hide these activities from the bank,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement. When the guarantees were revealed in 2016, foreign donors, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cut off support for Mozambique. Inner City Press inside the UN asked Mozambique diplomats about it - until it was without due process ousted from the UN, which it has now applied to reverse.",1
lge community credit union,Federal appeals court rules overdraft fee definitions must be unambiguous [Agence Maghreb Arabe Presse],"(JURIST) - The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held Tuesday that under the Federal Reserves Regulation E, which implemented the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a financial institution must clearly define the procedures used for overdraft fees.
The case, Tims v. LGE Community Credit Union (LGE), centered on two $30 overdraft fees that LGE charged Tims. Tims argued that, at the time the overdraft fees were assessed, she had enough funds in her ledger balance to cover her transactions. LGE countered that the contracts unambiguously stated that the credit union would use available balance to determine account overdrafts. The district court dismissed Tims claim under FRCP 12(b)(6) and determined that the contracts allowed LGE to use available balance to calculate overdraft fees. The Eleventh Circuit reversed.
We disagree with the district courts interpretation of the contracts. Because we conclude that the agreements are ambiguous as to whether LGE could rely on an accounts available balance, rather than its ledger balance, to assess overdraft fees, we reverse the district courts dismissal of the case and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
The case will now be remanded for further proceedings.",1

__________________________
2
This employment case concerns a choice-of-law clause in anarbitration agreement. The trial court interpreted the clause to meansome but not all individual employment claims must be arbitrated. Weconclude all of them must be arbitrated.
The facts are simple. RADC Enterprises, Inc. hired Mel R. Bravo tomanage a store. The parties signed a two-page arbitration agreementcovering ""all disputes"" arising from the employmentrelationship. On page two, near the end, the agreement added aone-sentence choice-of-law provision: ""This Agreement shall begoverned by and shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of theState of California.""
After RADC fired him, Bravo sued RADC on individual employmentclaims, as well as on representative claims under the Private AttorneysGeneral Act of 2004 (PAGA). RADC moved to stay Bravo's PAGA claimsand to compel arbitration on his individual claims.
The trial court severed and stayed the PAGA claims. The court foundRADC engaged in interstate commerce and thus the Federal Arbitration Actgoverned the agreement. But the court compelled arbitration for onlythree of Bravo's nine individual claims, denying the arbitrationmotion on the remaining six individual claims. The logic was that, whilethe Federal Arbitration Act did apply, the choice-of-law sentence meantthe parties wanted California law to govern their relationship.California Labor Code section 229 directs courts to disregard agreementsto arbitrate wage claims, so the trial court declined to sendBravo's remaining claims to arbitration. (Lab. Code, SS 229.)
On appeal, RADC correctly contends the choice-of-law provision didnot mean the parties wanted to oust arbitration from their arbitrationagreement. RADC rightly says the trial
3
court should have sent all Bravo's individual claims toarbitration.
We independently review contract interpretation where, as here,there is no extrinsic evidence about contract meaning and the facts areundisputed.
As RADC correctly explains, the choice-of-law clause does notremove any arbitration from this arbitration agreement. The firsttextual clue is the title: ""ARBITRATION AGREEMENT."" Thisagreement is for arbitration and not against it.
The text of the agreement swiftly announces its objective: theparties will arbitrate ""any and all disputes"" arising fromBravo's employment, ""including any claims brought by theEmployee related to wages"" under the California Labor Code. Themain point of the deal was to arbitrate all employment disputes. Theparties could not have intended to apply Labor Code section 229 to thiscontract because that section prohibits arbitrating wage claims andrequires courts to disregard private agreements to arbitrate. (Lab.Code, SS 229.) Applying this California law would contradict theparties' intent to arbitrate ""any and all disputes,""including claims ""related to wages . . . .""
Interpreting the choice-of-law provision to negate the purpose ofthe two-page agreement is incorrect. Readers must assume legal authorsmean to draft texts that cohere. To assume otherwise departs from commonsense and makes mischief. So we read documents to effectuate andharmonize all contract provisions. (E.g., Mastrobuono v. Shearson LehmanHutton, Inc. (1995) 514 U.S. 52, 63.) Bravo's interpretation of thechoice-of-law provision in this agreement is untenable because itunnecessarily sets one clause in conflict with the rest of theagreement. (Id. at p. 64.)
4
The choice-of-law provision becomes consistent with theparties' intent to arbitrate all disputes when we read ""thelaws of the State of California"" to include substantive principlesCalifornia courts would apply, but to exclude special rules limiting theauthority of arbitrators. (See Mastrobuono, supra, 514 U.S. at pp.63-64; Preston v. Ferrer (2008) 552 U.S. 346, 363.) This arbitrationagreement is like the one in Preston v. Ferrer, which contained asimilar choice-of-law provision. The Supreme Court of the United Statesinterpreted that agreement as we interpret this one. (Id. at pp.362-363.)
The trial court cited Mastick v. TD Ameritrade, Inc. (2012) 209Cal.App.4th 1258, 1264, which does not apply here. Mastick involved Codeof Civil Procedure section 1281.2, subdivision (c). That statute is notat issue here. The same goes for Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v.Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S.468, 471, 475-477. Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2, subdivision(c) permits a court to refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement orstay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation between aparty to the arbitration agreement and third parties not bound by it,where there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue oflaw or fact. (Id. at p. 471.) There are no third parties in this case.Cases dealing with this third-party statute do not apply where there areno third parties.
5
DISPOSITION
We affirm part of the trial court's order and reverse part ofit. We affirm the part severing the agreement provision requiring theparties to arbitrate the PAGA claims. We also affirm the order grantingRADC's motion as to three individual claims. We reverse the orderdenying the motion as to the remaining six individual claims. RADC isawarded costs on appeal.

hsbc holdings plc,Former HSBC banker pleads guilty in $1.8 billion French tax case [Hindustan Times (India)] | Former HSBC banker pleads guilty in $1.8 billion French tax case [Hindustan Times (India)],"India, Aug. 7 -- The former chief executive officer of HSBC Holdings Plc's Swiss private bank pleaded guilty to helping wealthy clients hide assets worth at least 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) as French prosecutors flex their muscles to tackle white-collar crime.
Peter Braunwalder was fined 500,000 euros and given a one-year suspended jail sentence, according to a Paris court ruling on the plea. The 68-year-old admitted that he took part in helping clients evade taxes between 2006 and 2007 by opening clandestine Swiss bank accounts and setting up offshore trusts or providing fake loans.
The former HSBC executive also pleaded guilty to illegally approaching French residents to encourage them to shift funds to Switzerland during the period, according to the previously unreported French ruling dated Jan. 29 and released this week. Braunwalder retired from his role at HSBC a decade ago.
The HSBC case is part of a French crackdown on tax fraud and money laundering operated through Switzerland that's seen the conviction of a former minister and UBS Group AG ordered in February to pay a record 4.5 billion-euro fine after being chastised by a judge for criminal wrongdoings of ""an exceptionally serious nature.""
Seeking Convictions
The Braunwalder guilty plea comes over a year after HSBC paid 300 million euros to resolve allegations in the same case. It's a sign that French financial prosecutors are determined to pursue individuals even after collecting large settlements.
Marion Lambert-Barret, a Paris lawyer who isn't involved in the HSBC investigation, says Braunwalder's sentence sends a clear deterrent message.
""The Parquet National Financier is heading the direction it said it would: Even if a company reaches a settlement, prosecutors will seek convictions for individuals to punish the underlying behavior they consider fraudulent,"" she said by phone.
Lambert-Barret said the outcome for Braunwalder shows suspects can negotiate with criminal authorities to avoid a drawn-out and uncertain process, but discussions and a voluntary plea deal don't lead to a more lenient sentence.
In the UBS over similar allegations that covered a much lengthier time period, three former executives each got 12-month suspended jail terms and 200,000-euro fines, while a fourth received a more severe penalty, a suspended sentence of 18 months and a penalty of 300,000 euros.
Stolen Data
French authorities began scrutinizing HSBC's Swiss private bank after Herve Falciani, a former information technology worker at the firm, stole client account details from the Geneva office in 2008 and shared the data with investigators.
France's PNF and Braunwalder's lawyer, Jean-Pierre Spitzer, declined to immediately comment, while HSBC representatives in France didn't respond to calls and an email. French investigators dropped charges targeting another suspect in the HSBC Private Bank case.
HSBC's November 2017 settlement was the first using a new procedure in France that enables companies to resolve investigations without pleading guilty. Societe Generale SA agreed last year to pay 250 million euros to end a bribery case and French fund manager Carmignac Gestion said in June it would pay 30 million euros to settle a tax-fraud case.

banco nacional de angola,Angola's sovereign wealth fund subject to major changes | Angola's sovereign wealth fund subject to major changes,"Angola's sovereign wealth fund subject to major changesAngola's sovereign wealth fund subject to major changesEventAngola's sovereign wealth fund, the Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA), has said that it plans to replace its main asset management company after the financial authorities in Mauritius froze accounts it was managing for the fund.AnalysisIn a statement the FSDEA said that it had ""great concerns about how Quantum Global"" had been investing the fund's money and that it was taking steps to remove the firm as its asset manager. In early April Mauritius's Supreme Court issued freezing orders for a number of Quantum Global bank accounts in the country and the Mauritian financial services regulator also suspended seven funds investing on behalf of Angola. Quantum Global has issued statements denying any wrongdoing and accusing its client of ""intimidating tactics"". Quantum Global is owned by a Swiss Angolan, Jean Claude Bastos de Morais, a close friend and former business partner of the FSDEA's former chairman, José Filomeno dos Santos, the eldest son of Angola's long-serving president, José Eduardo dos Santos. Mr dos Santos Junior was sacked from the FSDEA in January and he has since been charged with fraud, embezzlement, criminal association, trafficking of influence and money-laundering in relation to an allegedly illicit transfer of US$500m from the Banco Nacional de Angola (the central bank) to a Credit Suisse account in the UK in September 2017. The FSDEA, which was formed with a starting pot of US$5bn, has faced criticism of its management and investment strategy since its launch in 2012. For example, it decided, against international norms, to focus a significant portion of its investments in infrastructure-including a port project owned by Mr Bastos de Morais-and domestic tourism. The fund made international headlines in late 2017 after the so-called Paradise Papers (a leak of offshore legal records) revealed that it had paid out US$90m in fees to Quantum Global. The termination of the contract with Quantum Global appears to be yet another move by Angola's president, João Lourenço, to weaken his predecessor's influence over the economy and rebuild its reputation. A well-managed sovereign wealth fund is a valuable asset that has the potential to reduce Angola's vulnerability to oil price shocks and enable strategic domestic investment to help to build non-oil price growth.Impact on the forecastThe long-term impact of the FSDEA is unclear and thus we do not foresee any immediate change to our forecast for the overall economy and policy.",1

IRISL was designated by OFAC in September 2008 pursuant to Executive Order 13382 (""Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters""). Although many of the potentially prohibited transactions originated with MID-SHIP's subsidiaries in China and elsewhere, OFAC alleged that the company's U.S. headquarters provided accounting support and received commission payments related to these transactions. In addition, OFAC alleged that the company's senior management was aware of certain transactions and may have helped the company to evade detection by financial institution screening tools.
MID-SHIP agreed to pay $871,837 and committed to establishing sanctions compliance measures - consistent with OFAC's new compliance  Framework - to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR.JUSTICE A.Y. KOGJE


                    Date : 03/09/2019
                     ORAL ORDER


1. This petition is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the order dated 01.03.2017 by the Chief Controlling Revenue Officer in an Appeal bearing File No.9/2015. The matter pertains to Stamp Duty in connection with a Scheme of amalgamation of Companies under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to in short as 'the Act').


2. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that by an order dated 30.03.2012, the High Court passed an order of amalgamation under Section 349 of the Act by which five transferor companies were merged into the petitioner transferee Company by an order under Section 391 of the Act. Upon such development, the Collector and Additional Superintendent of Stamps, Gandhinagar determined the stamp duty payable on such transfer of assets upon an application filed by the petitioner under Section 311 of the Stamp Act. Upon the proceedings undertaken by the Collector and Additional Superintendent of Stamps, an order came to be passed where the petitioner was called upon to pay the stamp duty as under :-


(i) Rs.2,17,285/- in case of M/s. Chankya Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.


C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER


(ii) Rs.5,80,294/- in case of M/s. Chankya Infracon Pvt. Ltd.


(iii) Rs.3,49,440/- in case of M/s. Takshashila Property Pvt. Ltd.


(iv) Rs.2500/- in case of M/s. Takshashila Reality Ltd. and


(v) Rs.22,850/- in case of M/s. Youngstar Infracon Pvt. Ltd.


3. The petitioner had accordingly paid the Stamp duty. It is submitted that though the petitioner had paid the entire stamp Duty as assessed by the Collector and Stamp Superintendent, only on account of audit objection by the Accountant General, proceedings under Section 53(a) of the Gujarat Stamp Act were started against the petitioner and merely on account of objection only passed an order in Review and raised a demand of Rs.13,67,262/- being the stamp duty payable in case of the three transferor companies against which objections were raised by the Accountant General.


4. Learned Advocate for the petitioner submits that considering the definition of conveyance particularly in Section 2(g)(n), the order of amalgamation under Section 394 of the Act is to be treated as a conveyance and therefore, when the date of order of amalgamation the assets which stood in the name of the transferor company is only to be taken into consideration. It is submitted that the transferor company after initiation of proceedings of amalgamation before the High Court and the passing of order of amalgamation by the High Court, several land parcels belonging to the three transferor companies stood transferred to the third party by execution of proper conveyance deed duly stamped and no objection was raised thereafter. The audit objection therefore, is not substantiated as on the date of order of amalgamation, the property which stood transferred in the name of the petitioner can only be subject to the stamp duty and such exercise was already concluded.


5. Learned Advocate submits that the order of revenue also does not give any proper reasoning for the purpose of increase in the C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER stamp duty and has merely adopted the reasoning of the Accountant General. It is submitted that there is no provision including under Article 20(d) which provides for levy of stamp duty on immovable property which is being transferred as a result of amalgamation on the appointed day but provides for levy of stamp duty on immovable property which is being transferred as a result of amalgamation on the appointed day, but provides only for levy of stamp duty on market value of immovable property which is actually being transferred as a result of amalgamation.


6. It is submitted that when the parcels of land have been sold between the appointed date and the effect date and such transfer has been on the basis of a Conveyance Deed and duly stamped, there cannot be levy of stamp duty again for the same transfer.


7. As against this, learned Assistant Government Pleader has relied upon the Affidavit of the respondent No.2 and submits that the Scheme by which the amalgamation has taken place under the order of the High Court, the date of the Scheme is 01.04.2010. As per the condition No.6, the business with effect from appointed date upto the effective date, the transferor company is to carry on the business of the transferee company and all the profits and losses to be treated as profit and loss of the transferee company. In that view of the matter, the liabilities and assets of the company would stand transferred to the transferee company with effect from the appointed date. Learned Assistant Government Pleader referred to Article 20 more particularly to Explanation 3 to Clause (d). It is submitted that the levy of stamp duty ought to be calculated on the appointed date, i.e. on 01.04.2010 and the assets running in the name of the transferor company as on that date. It is submitted that when the transfer takes place under the amalgamation order and the transfer which has taken place by C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER way of a Sale Deed by the transferor company, in the interregnum period are to be treated as two separate transactions and therefore, the impugned order is justified.


8. Learned Advocate for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment dated 23.02.2010 of this Court in the case of E.I. Dupot India Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Gujarat thro' the Under Secretary and Other in Special Civil Application No.18319/2007 and allied matters.


9. I have heard learned Advocates for the parties and perused the records of the case. The petitioner is a Transferee Company under the Scheme of amalgamation which was approved by an order dated 30.03.2012 in a Company Petition No.70/2011 and other connected applications , by the amalgamation order, 5 transferor companies namely M/s. Chanakya Buildcon Pvt. Ltd., Chanakya Infracon Pvt. Ltd., M/s. Takshashila Properties Pvt. Ltd., M/s. Takshashila Realties Ltd. and M/s. Youngstar Infracon Pvt. Ltd. were amalgamated into the petitioner company. The scheme for amalgamation was sanctioned by the High Court by an order dated 30.03.2012.


10. The Accountant General raised an objection during the scrutiny in connection with the three transferor companies, M/s. Chanakya Infracon Private Limited, M/s. Takshashila Properties Private Limited and M/s. Youngstar Infracon Private Limited. The nature of objection was that while determining the market value by the Collector and Additional Superintendent of Stamps, the whole portion of the land being the asset of the Transferor Company was not considered and only the land area which existed on the Effective date was only considered.


11. As per the Scheme, the ""Appointed Date"" means the 1st day of April, 2010 or such other date as the Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat / National Company Law Tribunal may direct. The C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER ""Effective Date"" means the date on which certified copy of the order of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad / National Company Law Tribunal vesting the assets, properties, liabilities, rights, duties, obligations and the like of the Transferor Companies in the Transferee Company is filed with the Registrar of Companies, Gujarat at Ahmedabad after obtaining the consents, approvals, permissions, resolutions, agreements, sanctions and orders necessary therefor.


12. Relevant Clause 3(a) for Transfer and Vesting reads as under :-


""(a) Upon the coming into effect of this Scheme and with effect from the Appointed Date and subject to the provisions of the Scheme, the Undertaking of the Transferor Companies shall, pursuant to Section 394 of the Act, and without any further act or deed, be transferred to and vested in or be deemed to have been transferred to and vested in the Transferee Company as a going concern so as to become as and from the Appointed Date, the undertaking with all estate, assets, properties, rights, title and interest of the Transferee Company.""


13. Clause 6 of the Scheme is for CONDUCT OF BUSINESS BY TRANSFEROR COMPANIES TILL EFFECTIVE DATE and which reads as under :-


""With effect from the Appointed Date and up to the Effective Date :


(a) The Transferor Companies shall carry on and be deemed to carry on all its businesses and activities and stand possessed of its properties and assets for and on account of and in trust for the Transferee Company.


(b) All the profits accruing to the Transferor Companies or losses arising or incurred (including the effect of taxes, if any, thereon) by it shall, for all purposes, be treated as the profits or losses of the Transferee Company as the case may be.


(c) The Transferor Companies hereby undertakes to carry on its business until the Effective Date with reasonable diligence and shall not, without the written consent of the Transferee Company, alienate, charge or encumber or otherwise deal with the assets or any part thereof except C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER in the ordinary course of its business.


(d) The Transferor Companies shall not undertake any additional financial commitments of any nature whatsoever, borrow any amounts or incur any other liabilities or expenditure without the written consent of the Transferee Company, except in the ordinary course of business.


(e) The Transferor Companies shall not, without the written consent of the Transferee Company, undertake any new business.


(f) Save as specifically provided in this Scheme, neither the Transferor Companies nor the Transferee Company shall make any change in their capital structure by way of increase (whether by a rights issue, issue of equity or preference shares, bonus shares, convertible debentures or otherwise), decrease, reduction, reclassification, sub- division or consolidation, reoganisation or in any manner which may in any manner affect the Share Exchange Ratio prescribed in Clause 9 except by mutual consent of the Board of Directors of both the companies.


(g) The Transferor Companies shall not vary the terms and conditions of the service of its staff, workmen and employees except in the ordinary course of business.""


14. In the order under Section 394 in each of the Schedule of Property which was to be transferred was given, more particularly for the three transferor companies in respect of which the petitions were raised in case of M/s. Chanakya Infracon Private Limited, the total land area as on the appointed date being 14167.13 square meters. However, between 01.04.2010 to 28.03.2012, 10907.43 square meters of land was sold and therefore, the balance land of 3259.70 square meters of land stood transferred. Similarly, in case of M/s. Takshashila Properties Private Limited, the total land area as on the appointed date was 9601 square meters. 5233 square meters of land was sold between 01.04.2010 to 28.03.2012 and therefore, the land admeasuring 4368 square meters stood transferred by the amalgamation order dated 28.03.2012. Incase of M/s. Youngstar Infracon Private Limited on 01.04.2010, the total C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER land area was 8522 square meters, of which before 28.03.2012, 8065 square meters was sold and as on the date of order of amalgamation, 457 square meters of land was transferred on account of amalgamation. Therefore, it is the case of the petitioner that as on the date of amalgamation, the land holding which was available for transfer only is to be considered and the error is committed in calculating the other land areas as well by the Accountant General in its objection. The calculation of such additional stamp duty is as under :-





Sl.#      Name of the Transferor          Property     Jantri Market      Deficit

 15.          Article 20(d) reads as under :-



""in entry (d), for the words and figures ""so far as it relates to reconstruction for amalgamation of companies by an order of the High Court under section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956"", the words and figures ""so far as it relates to the scheme, for reconstruction of the company or companies involving merger or the amalgamation of any two or more companies by an order of the National Company Law Tribunal under section 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 or for amalgamation or dissolution of Banking Companies by an order of the Reserve Bank of India under section 44A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949"" shall be substituted :


Explanation II to Article 20(d) reads as under :-


""[Explanation II]. - For the purposes of this Article, the expression ""premises"" means any land or building or part of a building including any flat, apartment, tenement, shop or warehouse therein and includes :-


C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER


(i) gardens, grounds and out houses, if any, pertaining to such building or part of a building, and


(ii) any fittings affixed to such building or part of a building for the more beneficial enjoyment thereof.


The stamp duty as is payable under clauses (a) and (aa), as the case may be.]


(i) an amount equal to [1 per cent.] of the aggregate amount comprising of the market value of share issued of alloted in exchange of or otherwise or the face value of such shares, which ever is higher and the amount of consideration, of any paid for such amalgamation, or


(ii) an amount equal to [1 per cent] of the true market value of the immovable property situated in the State of Gujarat of the transferor company. whichever is higher.]


16. Considering the Scheme approved by the High Court, Clause 7 specifies that the Scheme although operative from the appointed date was effective from the effective date. However, clause 6 of the Scheme which pertains to the conduct of the business specifies that the transferor companies are to undertake and carry on the business only from the effective date.


17. It cannot be disputed that the transfer upon the amalgamation on the effective date of the assets which stood transferred to the transferee company upon the amalgamation is required to be levied with the Stamp duty. In the instant case, after the appointed date, the transfer was done/going on behalf of the transferee company (the petitioner) when it sold the parcel of land to the third persons under the conveyance deed but when the transfer was going on behalf of the transferee company, their land is to be the first transfer by way of some conveyance from the transferor company to the transferee company, in the instant case is a must. Therefore, in the instant case, the first stage of transfer is by the transferor company to the transferee company under the Scheme of amalgamation and therefore, the second transfer to the third party by the transferor company acting on behalf of the transferee company. This would indicate that there were to separate transactions of the land in question for the parcels of C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER land effected to third parties whereas in the instant case, stamp duty is levied only on deed of conveyance, i.e. conveyance through the sale deed in fovour of the third party after the effective date and no stamp duty upon amalgamation scheme and order of the High Court.


18. It appears that on account of the aforesaid reasoning, the appointed date is to be treated as the date on which the areas running in the name of the transferee company is to be considered for the purpose of levy of stamp duty. Qua the judgment relied on by learned Advocate on behalf of the petitioner in case of E.I. Dupot India Pvt. Ltd. (supra), the Court was considering the showcause notice issued under Section 39(1)(b) of the Bombay Stamp Act, which refers to the powers of the Collector to impound the instruments and in absence of any impounding of instruments by the Collector under Section 33 of the Act, where the jurisdiction can be exercised on the basis of the summons by the Accountant General. While dealing with the facts of the case, the Court held that the Deputy Collector has no powers to reopen the matter by calling upon the petitioner and to serve the impugned notice which is issued after more than a period of five years from the date of registration of instrument. Such facts would not be covering the facts of the present case.


19. Reliance is placed by learned Advocate for the petitioner upon the Full bench decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of The Chief Controlling Revenue Authority, Maharashtra State, Pune and another v. M/s. Reliance Industries Limited, Mumbai and Another reported in AIR 2016 BOMBAY 108. Here, the Court was examining the facts where the registered office of two companies were situated in two different cities which required sanction of the Scheme under Section 394 of the Companies Act by two different High Courts then the High Court had sanctioned the Scheme passed C/SCA/19011/2017 ORDER under Section 394 of the Companies Act, which will be the instrument chargeable to the stamp duty. While considering the entire case in light of the aforesaid facts, the reference was necessary to decision of the Full Bench and the relevant question in Paragraph 35 is answered accordingly :-


""(ii) Whether the instrument in respect of amalgamation or compromise or scheme between the two Companies is such a scheme, compromise or arrangement and the orders sanctioning the same are incidental as the computation of stamp duty and valuation is solely based on the scheme and the scheme alone?


Ans. The orders of the court, sanctioning a Scheme of amalgamation are not just incidental orders even in accordance with the Scheme of the Companies Act laid down by Section 391 r/w. Section 394. Only after the orders are passed by the Court, sanctioning the Scheme of Amalgamation, such a scheme becomes operational and effective. Computation of stamp duty and valuation does not make Scheme of Amalgamation alone chargeable to stamp duty. The order is the instrument.""


20. The aforesaid also in the opinion of the Court does not lay down that for the purpose of considering the asset of the transferor company, the assets as on the date of the order of amalgamation is relevant.


21. The Court finds no error in the impugned order dated 01.03.2017 passed by the Accountant General and therefore, does not deem it fit to interfere with such an order. The petition therefore, deserves to be dismissed and is hereby dismissed. Notice is discharged. Interim relief granted earlier, stands vacated.

robert bosch gmbh,"Germanys Bosch fined US$100M over diesel scandal [Trends (Middle East)] | Germanys Bosch fined US$100M over diesel scandal [Governance, Risk & Compliance Monitor Worldwide] | Germany's Bosch fined $100 million over diesel scandal","German prosecutors have fined auto parts and technology company Bosch 90 million euros (US$100 million) over its role in the diesel emissions scandal that erupted at Volkswagen in 2015.
Prosecutors in Stuttgart said Wednesday that the company, formally called Robert Bosch GmbH, was fined for a negligent violation of supervisory obligations, and that the company had decided not to appeal.
Bosch delivered millions of engine control systems that were installed on various manufacturers cars starting in 2008 and whose software, in prosecutors words, contained in part prohibited strategies leading to cars emitting more nitrogen oxide than permitted by regulators.
However, prosecutors said they believe that the initiative to integrate and shape the prohibited strategies came from employees of the auto manufacturers.
They said that the fine does not affect ongoing criminal probes of Bosch employees. The bulk of the fine 88 million euros stems from profits on the sales of the parts, with the remaining 2 million euros covering the misdemeanour itself.
Prosecutors said that they took account of Bosch managers full and constructive co-operation with investigators since 2015.
Bosch agreed to a $327.5 million civil settlement in the United States for supplying emissions software to Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche vehicles that enabled cheating on diesel emissions tests.
The diesel emissions scandal has cost Volkswagen itself billions of euros.",1
airbus,Manslaughter & negligence: Air France could face trial over 2009 crash [Eturbo News],"U.S., July 17 -- French prosecutors have recommended that Air France face trial for manslaughter and negligence in the 2009 crash which killed 228 people on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.
The investigators concluding that the airline was aware of technical problems with a speed-measuring instrument on its Airbus A330 plane.
The airline did not inform pilots or train them in how to resolve the issues, however, according to an investigation document seen by Agence France-Presse. The prosecutors also recommended dropping the case against Airbus, the manufacturer.
A 2012 report into the crash by French air crash investigator BEA concluded that errors by pilots and failure to react swiftly after speed sensors malfunctioned led to the crash.
Investigating magistrates will decide whether to follow advice from prosecutors and bring a case to court, but Air France will be able to appeal any decision to bring a trial.
Flight AF447 tragically crashed into the Atlantic Ocean during a storm on June 1, 2009 - but the full wreckage was not located until two years later. It was found off the Brazilian coast by remote-controlled submarines at a depth of 13,000ft. Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

genus plc,Genus Says Seller Of Its Sexing Semen Technology In US To Pay Damages,"(Alliance News) - Animal genetics firm Genus PLC on Wednesday said that the sellers of its sexing semen technology, which was ruled to have breached three US patents, have been told by a jury to pay an additional amount in damages.
The jury in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin held that ABS Global Inc, which sold the Genus technology under the IntelliGen brand, should pay USD2.60 for each of the 3.3 million straws of the product it sold up to June 30. This will mean ABS will pay roughly USD8.5 million. The court had ruled that IntelliGen had infringed patents held by Inguran LLC and Cytonome/ST LLC
This decision was only in respect to its breaches of two US patents 7,311,476 and 7,611,309. ABS Global is considering its options for appeal, Genus added.
The damages outlined on Wednesday are separate to the USD1.25 royalty ABS Global must pay for every straw produced in respect to the breach of patent 8,206,987, a verdict Genus had announced on Tuesday.
All damages will be retrospective, as ABS Global has since changed its IntelliGen technology.
The litigation forms ""part of a long-running dispute since 2014"" between ABS Global, Inguran, and Cytonome/ST, Genus said.
In 2014, the court said that Cytonome ""had wilfully maintained an illegal monopoly in the US market for sexed bovine semen processing"" and found that ABS Global infringed patent 8,206,987, though this was sent back to the court for a trial.
In 2017, Cytonome filed patent infringements proceedings against Genus and ABS Global, alleging the IntelliGen technology breached seven US patents. ABS Global successfully disputed that it did not infringe five of these patents.
Shares in Genus were marginally higher at 2,855.36 pence each in London on Wednesday morning.",1
"alaska airlines, inc.",FBI joining criminal investigation into certification of Boeing 737 MAX | FBI joining criminal investigation into certification of Boeing 737 MAX | FBI joining criminal investigation into certification of Boeing 737 MAX,"March 21--     Mar. 21--The FBI has joined the criminal investigation into the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX, lending its considerable resources to an inquiry already being conducted by U.S. Department of Transportation agents, according to people familiar with the matter.
The federal grand jury investigation, based in Washington, D.C., is looking into the certification process that approved the safety of the new Boeing plane, two of which have crashed since October.
The FBI's Seattle field office lies in proximity to Boeing's 737 manufacturing plant in Renton, as well as nearby offices of Boeing and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officials involved in the certification of the plane.
The investigation, which is being overseen by the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division and carried out by the Transportation Department's Inspector General, began in response to information obtained after a Lion Air 737 MAX 8 crashed shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on Oct. 29, killing 189 people, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing an unnamed source.
It has widened since then, The Associated Press reported this week, with the grand jury issuing a subpoena on March 11 for information from someone involved in the plane's development, one day after the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX 8 near Addis Ababa that killed 157 people.
The FBI's support role was described by people on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the investigation.
Advertising
Representatives of the Justice Department, the FBI and Transportation Department declined to comment, saying they could neither confirm nor deny an investigation. Boeing declined to comment.
A Seattle Times story on Sunday detailed how FAA managers pushed its engineers to delegate more of the certification process to Boeing itself. The Times story also detailed flaws in an original safety analysis that Boeing delivered to the FAA.
Two days later, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao took the unusual step of asking the department's inspector general to conduct a formal audit of the certification process for the MAX. The audit is an administrative action, separate from the criminal investigation.
Criminal investigations into the U.S. aviation industry, including federal oversight of airplane manufacturing and airline operations, are rare -- in part because of the longstanding belief that a civil-enforcement system better promotes candid reporting of concerns without fear of criminal repercussions.
Those criminal cases that have occurred have focused on false entries and misrepresentations.
In 1998, Transportation Department and FBI agents, acting on a whistleblower's allegations, served a criminal search warrant on Alaska Airlines, seeking evidence of maintenance irregularities.
Advertising
The investigation expanded to include the January 2000 crash of Alaska Flight 261 that killed 88 people, which the National Transportation Safety Board later blamed on the airline's faulty maintenance practices and poor FAA oversight.
But no criminal charges were filed, although the FAA, in a separate administrative review, ultimately found that Alaska and three of its managers had violated safety regulations, fining the carrier $44,000, revoking the mechanic licenses of two of the managers and suspending the license of the third.
Federal criminal charges were brought over the May 11, 1996, ValuJet Flight 592 crash that took off from Miami International Airport and plunged into the Everglades minutes later, killing 110 people.
Federal prosecutors in Florida filed a 24-count indictment against SabreTech, an airline maintenance contractor, and its workers over alleged violations in the handling of oxygen containers blamed for the crash. SabreTech was found guilty on nine counts but was acquitted on conspiracy charges, according to news reports. An appeals court later overturned all but one of the counts, the improper training of employees.
One issue that has arisen in criminal investigations of safety matters is whether they deter people from cooperating in other government investigations and civil proceedings.
In 2000, the National Transportation Safety Board warned that its findings on the cause of the 1999 deadly pipeline explosion in Bellingham could be indefinitely delayed because of a separate criminal investigation that had silenced key witnesses.
Then-NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said his agency had yet to question eight computer-room operators at Olympic Pipe Line who invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination shortly after the June 10 blast that killed two boys and led to the death of a young man.
Eric Weiss, an NTSB spokesman, said he couldn't comment on whether any individuals have declined to provide information on the Boeing 737 MAX crashes in light of the criminal investigation.

consolidated electrical distributors inc,Trial date set in Mason City Country Club golf cart death in 2018,"A wrongful death lawsuit has been filed on behalf of a man who died in a golf cart accident at Mason City Country Club in August 2018.
On Aug. 23, 2018, Derrick Berhow, 34, of Belmond, died at the hospital after falling off a golf cart at the country club.
Keith Halfwassen of Jewell was driving a golf cart in the parking lot of the country club with Berhow standing on the back of the cart, Iowa State Patrol reported at the time.
As Halfwassen turned the cart, Berhow fell off and struck the pavement, according to officials.
Mason City Fire medics transported Berhow to Mercy Medical Center--North Iowa, where he later died from the injuries.
The Iowa State Patrol is assisting the Mason City Police Department in the investigation. No charges were ever filed against Halfwassen.
Berhow's estate, along with his wife Mandy Berhow and their child, filed a wrongful death lawsuit in Cerro Gordo County Court on Feb. 18.
The family and estate is represented by Thomas Reavely and Gary Goudelock Jr. with Whitfield & Eddy Law of Des Moines.
The lawsuit was filed against Halfwassen, Mason City Country Club Inc., and Consolidated Electrical Distributors Inc., doing business as Culver Hahn Electric Supply.
According to the lawsuit, Culver Hahn sponsored a golf outing at the country club and provided alcoholic beverages to participants during the outing.
Both Berhow and Halfwassen participated.
""Halfwassen was served and consumed alcoholic beverages during the golf outing on August 23, 2018,"" the lawsuit said. ""Toward the end of the golf outing, Derrick Berhow was allowed to stand on a back of the golf cart at the Mason City Country Club Inc. As the golf cart was being driven by Halfwassen, and as Berhow was standing on the back of the golf cart, Berhow fell off the golf cart striking his head resulting in his death.""
Halfwassen was deemed intoxicated at the time of the accident as a result of a blood alcohol test.
""Mason City County (sic) Club, Inc., by and through its employees, sold and served Keith Halfwassen beer or liquor to a point where it knew or should have known that Keith Halfwassen would become intoxicated,"" the lawsuit claimed.
The family is seeking damages including burial expenses, the present value of the amount of financial support which Berhow would have contributed to his son, Mandy Berhow's loss of her husband, the child's loss of a father, loss of net accumulation to the estate, pre-death pain and suffering, medical expenses and any other damages recognized by Iowa law.
The lawsuit accused the country club, Halfwassen and Culver Hahn of negligence.
The lawsuit claims that the country had a duty to provide a safe environment for guests.
According to the lawsuit, Mason City Country Club breached its duties in several ways, including the following:
Allowing golfers at the Country Club to stand on the back of a golf cart while the golf cart was in operation. Allowing golfers at the Country Club to violate the rules and regulations of the Mason City Country Club, Inc.Serving alcoholic beverages to the Halfwassen in an amount that allowed Halfwassen to become intoxicated.Failing to adequately supervise invitees at the golf outing.Failing to follow the proper safety procedure for the operation of the golf course;Allowing intoxicated individuals to operate golf carts on its premises.Allowing an unsafe condition to exist on its premises.
Halfwassen was accused of operating a golf cart in a unsafe manner while intoxicated and allowing Berhow to ride on the back of the golf cart.
""By sponsoring the golf outing, Defendant Culver Hahn had a duty to provide a safe environment for the participants and to follow all the rules of the Mason City Country Club,"" the lawsuit said.
Culver Hahn filed a response March 6 denying many of the claims, saying the company did not provide alcohol to attendees directly.
""Mr. Berhow was allowed to participate in the golf outing on the day in question and his golf was paid for by Defendant (Culver Hahn),"" the company said in a response. ""The Defendant owed no duty to Mr. Berhow on the day in question in regard to his safety. The Defendant was not the owner of the premises and never had any control over the premises or the golf cart in question.""
Halfwassen responded to the lawsuit on March 13, noting that Culver Hahn provided drink tickets to those attending. He admitted to consuming alcohol that day but denied fault in Berhow's death.
Mason City Country Club responded March 27 and denied most of the allegations.
""Actions by the Decedent (Berhow) not due to and other than intoxication, were the cause of injury and to the extent of the Decedent's intoxication caused the incident, the doctrine of complicity applies,"" The country club said in the answer. ""The Decedent assumed the risk f his behavior and assented to the activity.""
The lawsuit did not specify how much relief is requested. The order setting trial noted that the ""amount in controversy exceeds $10,000.""
Judge Chris C. Foy has been appointed to this case.
The trial date is set for Aug. 4, 2020 in Cerro Gordo County.",1
independence of the seas,Sky Pad ride suspended on 2 Royal Caribbean ships | Sky Pad ride suspended on two Royal Caribbean ships,"April 09--     Apr. 9--Royal Caribbean has temporarily closed its new trampoline bungee ""Sky Pad"" ride on two of its cruise ships after a passenger filed a lawsuit last month.
""As part of our commitment to safety, we are temporarily taking Sky Pad out of service on Mariner of Seas and Independence of the Seas,"" the Miami-based cruise line said in a statement.
On its blog Sunday, the cruise line also responded to a passenger that the ride was ""temporarily unavailable. We're currently conducting a review as the safety as part of our commitment to safety for all of our guests.""
The Tweet added, ""We're still running reviews and inspections.""
The cruise line has described the ""Sky Pad"" as a bungee trampoline experience. Riders don a virtual reality headset and are then strapped to a harness that allows them to leap and perform flips. In photos, the ride looks like a big ball with holes carved out.
On March 12 passenger Casey Holladay, 25, filed a $10 million federal lawsuit against the cruise line after he fell 20-feet while using the feature on the Mariner of the Seas during a February cruise with his girlfriend.
Holladay's attorney Brett Rivkind told the Sun Sentinel last month that Holladay suffered a fractured pelvis from the fall and he was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.
Upon learning of the ride's suspension, Rivkind said on Tuesday ""it is obvious they have finally recognized the Sky Pad is unsafe and RCCL (Royal Caribbean Cruises Limited) must do the proper safety analysis and risk assessment that should of been performed before launching this activity on their ships.""
He added, ""Casey is angry and sad he had to be one of the motivating factors for this to happen.""
The Mariner of the Seas sails out of Miami for three to four night cruises to the Bahamas; the Independence of the Seas sails out of Fort Lauderdale for four to five night Caribbean cruises.
The Sky Pad is also featured on the Asia-based Spectrum of the Seas which was not addressed in the cruise line's social media responses about the ride's suspension.",1
anadarko petroleum corp,Release of federal report on fatal 2017 Firestone home explosion delayed | Release of federal report on fatal 2017 Firestone home explosion delayed,"The National Transportation Safety Board has delayed the release of its report on the fatal 2017 Firestone home explosion caused by leaking equipment attached to an oil and gas well.
Colorado Department of Natural Resources spokesman Travis Duncan confirmed the state commission that oversees the oil and gas extraction industry is waiting until the federal agency's report is released before the state takes any action on the incident. The commission has not charged any fines to any parties associated with the incident.
But officials with the state agency, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, had no comment on whether a monetary penalty would be considered by the state, Duncan said.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. owned the vertical well to which a leaking flowline that caused the explosion was attached. The company acquired the well in a land swap with Noble Energy.
Duncan said the state had been informed the report's release is now expected in May or June. But National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Eric Weiss said the agency's probes do not have a ""time-certain date"" for closing, adding they usually last between one and two years.
""There is no cookie-cutter approach to investigations. Every investigation is different and we follow the facts where they lead,"" Weiss said.
AdvertisementThe blast killed Mark Martinez and Joey Irwin, the husband and brother, respectively, of Erin Martinez, who was injured in the incident. The widow stood beside Gov. Jared Polis and Boulder state lawmakers Thursday to support a bill proposing sweeping oil and gas regulatory reform Democrats plan to introduce in the state Legislature. She also spoke at the news conference and shared her story about the blast.
Colorado Public Radio first reported the federal agency's delay of the report's release.
The recent record-long government shutdown was a reason for the setback because the investigator on the case was not working during the funding impasse, Weiss said.
Additionally, progress on the Firestone incident stalled when the case's lead investigator retired last year. A new investigator was put on the case last fall, Weiss said.
""It's difficult to find someone who can step in off the street and be an investigator in charge on pipeline investigations for the NTSB. That took a while,"" Weiss said.
Remaining steps for the agency in the investigation are writing a report, finishing fact finding and forming an analysis, Weiss said.

boeing company (the),"KESSLER TOPAZ MELTZER & CHECK, LLP  Reminds Investors of Securities Fraud Class Action Lawsuit Against THE BOEING COMPANY  BA [African Manager (Tunisia)]","(GlobeNewswire) - The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP reminds investors that a securities fraud class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA) (Boeing) on behalf of those who purchased or otherwise acquired Boeing securities between January 8, 2019 and March 21, 2019, inclusive (the Class Period).
Important Deadline: Investors who purchased Boeing securities during the Class Period may, no later than June 10, 2019, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this litigation please visit www.ktmc.com/boeing-ba-securities-class-action.
According to the complaint, Boeing, together with its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds major aerospace firms. It is organized based on the products and services it offers and operates in four reportable segments: (a) Commercial Airplanes (BCA); (b) Defense, Space & Security; (c) Global Services; and (d) Boeing Capital. The BCA segment develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft and provides fleet support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. On October 29, 2018, shortly after takeoff, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed, killing all aboard. Then, on March 10, 2019, shortly after takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed, killing all aboard. The airplanes that crashed were Boeing 737 MAX jets.
The Class Period commences on January 8, 2019, when the defendants issued a press release entitled, Boeing Sets New Airplane Delivery Records, Expands Order Backlog, Delivered 806 commercial jets in 2018 with record-setting fourth quarter, Won nearly 900 net orders valued at $143.7 billion after finalizing more than 200 orders in December, 737 MAX family surpassed 5,000 orders; 777 family exceeded 2,000 orders. The complaint alleges that, following the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, on March 11, 2019, Ethiopian Airlines grounded its 737 MAX 8. Similarly, the China Civil Aviation Administration grounded the 737 MAX 8. Following this news, the price of Boeing shares fell $47.13 per share, or 11.2%, during the two trading days ended March 12, 2019.
Since then, the 737 MAX series aircraft has been grounded by every country and is no longer permitted to fly. In addition, the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the FBI reportedly opened investigations into the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification process and into safety-review processes.
On March 21, 2019, The New York Times reported in an article entitled, Doomed Boeing Jets Lacked 2 Safety Features That Company Sold Only as Extras, that Boeing has hidden from investors, pilots and passengers, that because of the safety compromised, Boeing created two new safety features that it sold as extras or optional features to keep costs down. Following this news, the price of Boeing shares fell $10.53 per share, or about 3%, on March 22, 2019.
The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, the defendants misled investors about the sustainability of Boeings core operation the BCA by touting its growth prospects and profitability, raising guidance, and maintaining that the 737 MAX was the safest airplane to fly the skies. Boeing made these statements all while concealing the full extent of safety problems caused by the placement of larger engines on the 737 MAX that changed the handling characteristics of the 737 MAX from previous models. The complaint further alleges that Boeing hid from investors and passengers that it prepared its own reports and statements to the FAA certifying its planes as safe to fly and that these statements and reports were undermined by Boeings conflicts of interest in having been delegated authority by the FAA to examine, test, and help certify its own planes and to provide the safety analysis for the 737 MAX. Boeing also hid the fact that Boeing withheld necessary safety features from the Boeing 737 MAX unless airlines purchased them as extras or optional features in order to keep the price down.

jason flack,"Head of Coin Drop Markets pleads guilty to fraud [Utilities Middle East (United Arab Emirates)] | Head of Coin Drop Markets pleads guilty to fraud [Governance, Risk & Compliance Monitor Worldwide]","Patrick McDonnell, also known as Jason Flack, pleaded guilty at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in virtual currency.
On June 21, 2019, Patrick McDonnell, also known as Jason Flack, pleaded guilty at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud investors in virtual currency. He now faces up to 20 years in prison as well as forfeiture and restitution to his victims. The plea took place before United States District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis.
Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and Philip R. Bartlett, Inspector-in-Charge, United States Postal Inspection Service, New York Division (USPIS), announced the guilty plea.
According to the Indictment, between approximately November 2014 and January 2018, McDonnell portrayed himself as an experienced trader in virtual currency, promising investors he would provide trading advice and purchase and trade virtual currency on their behalf. Beginning in approximately May 2016, McDonnell made similar representations through his Staten Island-based company, CabbageTech, Corp., also known as Coin Drop Markets. However, neither McDonnell nor CabbageTech provided investment services.
Instead, McDonnell sent investors false balance statements purportedly showing that their investments had been profitable, and stole their money for his personal use. McDonnell defrauded at least 10 victims of at least $194,000 in U.S. currency, 4.41 Bitcoin, 206 Litecoin, 620 Ethereum Classic and 1,342,634 Verge.
Lets recall that, back in August 2018, the case brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against McDonnell concluded at the New York Eastern District Court. Judge Jack B. Weinstein entered a final judgement in favor of the CFTC and against defendants Patrick K. McDonnell and CabbageTech also known as Coin Drop Markets.
A permanent injunction was issued against the fraudsters. The defendants were also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $290,429, as well as a civil monetary penalty of $871,287.",1

HIS HONOUR:
1 These reasons concern the costs of a trial in which the plaintiff('Morris') and the fourth defendant ('GoGetta')sought payment out of Funds in Court of monies due to them by SusanAlameddine, secured by charges over a property at 136 Lisbon Road,Fairfield East, New South Wales ('Property'). The proceeds ofthe sale of that Property had been paid into this Court by the firstmortgagee, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia ('CBA').
2 I delivered reasons for judgment on 18 May 2017.[1] I found thatMorris had the prior equity in the proceeds of the sale of the Propertyand had established its judgement debt of $78,389.72 plus interest to 29April 2016 in the sum of $17,646.55 and legal costs of $66,098.46. Iconcluded, however, that the legal costs of Morris should be reduced by$13,000.00 because Morris had changed the basis upon which it made itsclaim at the last minute and approximately 25 per cent of itsprofessional legal costs ought not to have been incurred and should notbe recovered.
3 I indicated that I would allow short written submissions as tothe appropriate order, including the interest on the Morris judgementdebt since 29 April 2016 and the costs of the proceeding. Morris andGoGetta have made written submissions as has the third defendant, who isthe official trustee in bankruptcy of the bankrupt estate of MsAlameddine ('Trustee').
Applicable Law
4 The starting point is the Court's general power as to costs.Unless otherwise expressly provided by any Act or by the Rules,[2] thecosts of and incidental to all matters in the Supreme Court are in theCourt's discretion and the Court has full power to determine bywhom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.[3]
5 The discretion regarding costs has been described as absolute,unconfined or unfettered, although that discretion must be exercisedjudicially, that is, not by reference to irrelevant or extraneousconsiderations, but upon facts connected with or leading up to thelitigation.[4] In the exercise of the discretion, practices orguidelines have been developed.[5] These practices or guidelines are notlegal rules that confine the exercise of the discretion.[6]
6 Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, there is asettled practice (sometimes called a general rule) that in the absenceof good reason to the contrary, a successful litigant should receive hisor her costs.[7] It is not, however, a legal rule devised to control theexercise of the discretion.[8] The defendant conceded that the generalrule applied in this case so that it was appropriate that the defendantbe ordered to pay the plaintiffs' costs, but only on a standardbasis.
Calderbank offer
7 In Hazeldene's Chicken Farm Pty Ltd v Victorian WorkCoverAuthority (No 2),[9] the Victorian Court of Appeal said in relation toCalderbank offers that the critical question was whether the rejectionof the offer was unreasonable in the circumstances. Deciding whetherconduct is unreasonable involves matters of judgment and impression. TheCourt in Hazeldene held that, when considering whether the rejection ofa Calderbank offer was unreasonable, a court should ordinarily haveregard at least to the following matters:
(a) the stage of the proceeding at which the offer was received;
(b) the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer;
(c) the extent of the compromise offered;
(d) the offeree's prospects of success, assessed as at thedate of the offer;
(e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed;and
(f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for indemnitycosts in the event of the offeree's rejecting it.
Submissions
8 Morris submitted that the orders should be as follows:
(a) the following sum be paid from Common Fund No. 1 and debited toAccount No. 79413:
(i) to the plaintiff the sum of $164,801.00;
(ii) to the fourth defendant an amount equal to the balance of theAccount-
but subject to the retention of a sum sufficient to cover anytaxation liability;
(b) upon payment:
(i) to the plaintiff of the sum of $164,801.00;
(ii) to the fourth defendant an amount equal to the balance ofAccount No. 79413-
there also be paid to the fourth defendant from Common Fund No. 1and debited to Account No. 10, an amount equivalent to interest accruedon the balance of the Account from 1 June 2016 at the rate last fixed inrespect of Common Fund No. 1; and
(c) the fourth defendant pay the costs of the plaintiff of theproceeding to be taxed on an indemnity basis from 15 February 2016.
9 The calculation of the sum of $164,801.00 to be paid to theplaintiff is comprised of:
(a) the amount that I found proven to be due to Morris in respectof its judgement debt, interest and adjusted costs in the sum of$149,134.73; and
(b) interest at the rate of $16.11 per day from 30 April 2016 to 1June 2017, in the sum of $6,564.87, plus a further sum for legal costsof $9,101.40. These legal costs were made up of the sum of:
(i) $8,177.40 in respect of the legal costs incurred by Morris fromMay 2016, as set out in the affidavit of Christopher Yam sworn 2 June2017;[10] and
(ii) $924.00 for the costs to be incurred of and incidental to thepayment of the funds out of Court and the finalisation of the matter,including submissions in relation to the final orders to be made.
10 Morris relied on the principles applicable to the award of costsreferred to above and in particular the settled practice, or generalrule, that in the absence of good reason to the contrary, a successfullitigant should receive their costs. In addition, the basis upon whichMorris submitted that GoGetta should pay the plaintiff's costs ofthe proceeding taxed on an indemnity basis from 15 February 2016 wasthat on that date, Morris made an offer to GoGetta to settle theproceeding, such offer being said to be in the form of a Calderbankoffer. The offer was open for acceptance by 5pm on 17 February 2016. Itwas not accepted.
11 GoGetta agreed that pursuant to the reasons for judgment Morriswas entitled to the sum of $149,134.73 together with interest calculatedfrom 30 April 2016 to 1 June 2017 at the daily rate of $16.11, making atotal for interest of $6,564.87. GoGetta submits, however, that it isentitled to an award for costs against the plaintiff because it has beencompelled to incur costs unnecessarily as a consequence of the behaviourof the plaintiff, in particular the change of position of the plaintiffat the last minute to base the calculation of its claim upon a judgmentin the Local Court of NSW rather than upon the lease provisions whichgave rise to that judgment.
12 GoGetta also submits that Morris was not wholly successful inits claim whereas GoGetta has been successful both in its claim to aninterest in the Fund as well as in its application to dismiss the claimmade by the second defendant ('Uyanik') and in relation to theclaim of the Trustee. GoGetta thus submitted that indemnity costs shouldbe awarded in its favour against Morris, Uyanik and the Trustee in suchproportion as the Court considers appropriate. In this regard, it reliedon prior submissions it made in relation to the conduct of all of thoseparties which showed that they had given rise to a wastage of costs.[11]
13 GoGetta also resists any order for costs based upon theCalderbank letter because it is not an offer made in accordance with theprinciples in Calderbank v Calderbank.[12] One of the matters identifiedas being particularly relevant to whether the principles in theCalderbank decision were applicable was that the second and thirddefendants were still participating in the proceeding at the time of theoffer and had not consented to any distribution of the funds inaccordance with the offer, so that it was not capable of ending theproceeding.
14 It was also submitted by GoGetta that the calculation of themonies due to Morris as set out in the reasons for judgment[13] alreadyincluded provision for the costs incurred by Morris up to the time ofthe trial. These costs were the actual costs Morris proved it hadincurred. To add an order for costs against GoGetta would be duplicatingthe costs and unjustly enriching Morris.
15 The Trustee also made submissions in response to GoGetta'ssubmissions that Morris, Uyanik and the Trustee should payGoGetta's costs in a proportion considered appropriate by theCourt. The Trustee submitted that it ought not be the subject of anyorder for costs in favour of GoGetta for the following reasons:
(a) it was a party to the proceeding because it had lodged a caveatto protect its legal entitlement to any surplus proceeds from the saleof the Property after payment of creditors with established priorsecurity interests;
(b) save for filing a notice of appearance and attending themediation, the Trustee did not otherwise file any material or appear atany hearing;
(c) it was required to attend the mediation by order of the Courtand thus any costs caused to be wasted by the other parties by theattendance of the Trustee was not brought about by it;
(d) it was right for the Trustee to attend the mediation for theadditional reason that there may have been surplus funds availablehaving regard to the legal and factual issues that had been agitated atthat time. Subsequent to the mediation, Uyanik's claim wasdismissed and much of the criticism made by GoGetta of the claim made byMorris was overcome by the altered basis upon which it calculated itsclaim (based upon the New South Wales Local Court judgment); and
(e) ultimately, the Trustee did not participate beyond themediation and informed the Court by letter dated 22 April 2016 that itwas content to be bound by the judgment of the Court and sought to beexcused from participating in the proceeding further, save that in theevent that any order for costs were sought against it, it would desireto make submissions in opposition to such an order.
Analysis
16 It is common ground that in accordance with the reasons forjudgment, Morris is entitled to the sum of $149,134.73 plus interestfrom 30 April 2016 to 1 June 2017 in the sum of $6,564.87, making atotal of $155,699.60. The dispute arises between Morris and GoGetta inrelation to the costs incurred by Morris since the trial, and whetherMorris should recover them or whether GoGetta should have its costs ofthe proceeding against Morris. There are also disputes regarding theeffect of the Calderbank letter and whether there should be costsordered in favour of GoGetta against Uyanik and the Trustee.
17 I agree with the submissions of GoGetta, that to award costs toMorris, in the form submitted by it, would give rise to duplication andthe unjust enrichment of Morris. That is because I have allowed forMorris' costs up to April 2016 in the total amount of $149,134.73that I have determined Morris is entitled to (out of the Fund as at 29April 2016). It would therefore be wrong to award Morris costs againstGoGetta in respect of work performed up to the end of April 2016.
18 The central question is, therefore, whether Morris is entitledto claim the legal costs it incurred after the trial, or whether thecircumstances warrant an order for costs in favour of GoGetta.
19 Morris has had success in establishing the priority of its claimto the Fund to the extent of its judgement debt interest and adjustedcosts. Similarly, GoGetta has successfully applied to strike out theclaim made by Uyanik, success which benefits both Morris and GoGetta,and has successfully proved its claim to such part of the Fund asremains after Morris is paid.
20 It is also true that GoGetta has incurred costs, particularly inthe analysis of the calculation of Morris' claim prior to itschange of position, which it has incurred because of the conduct ofMorris. These costs are the equivalent in point of principle to thecosts that I have subtracted from Morris' claim which gives rise tothe adjusted costs allowed to it.
21 Much of the post-trial costs incurred by Morris relate to thelate filed affidavit of Leuhman and the written submissions filed, asordered, after the conclusion of the trial. Despite admitting thataffidavit in the interests of the due administration of justice, it wasfiled initially without leave and came as a surprise to GoGetta and theCourt. This is not conduct that should be rewarded. It is also relevantthat the trial was unable to continue after the lunch adjournment on 26April 2016 because of the unavailability of the solicitor advocate forMorris. That was the essential reason why written submissions wereordered to be filed and served. There is no reason why Morris shouldreceive costs incurred partly through its own solicitor's conduct,nor should GoGetta be burdened by them.
22 These considerations lead me to the conclusion that it is notappropriate to award any post-trial costs to Morris, either out of theFund or against GoGetta.
23 Despite GoGetta's s success in establishing its entitlementto the balance of the Fund, it has failed in its prime submissions thatwould have had the effect of defeating the claim of Morris and thusadvancing its own claim in preference. Further, because refusingMorris's post-trial costs will increase the balance of the Fundavailable to GoGetta, and GoGetta will receive the whole of the balanceof the Fund, GoGetta will receive a greater amount out of the Fund. Forthese reasons, it is not appropriate to award costs in favour of GoGettaagainst Morris.
24 It is thus strictly unnecessary to deal with the supposedCalderbank letter. However, I will deal briefly with the parties'submissions. I refer above to the considerations that need to be takeninto account in assessing whether a Calderbank letter should give riseto an order for indemnity costs in favour of the party making the offer.In this case, the Calderbank letter given by Morris on 15 February 2016expressed the basis upon which it was entitled to succeed in accordancewith the basis then exposed in the affidavits in support of its claim.As I set out in the reasons for judgment, that basis changed, andchanged at the last minute after the conclusion of the trial, whenMorris made submissions (as ordered) supported by a late affidavit thatchanged the basis upon which the calculation of its claim was made.
25 The change in the basis upon which Morris has succeeded, has theconsequence that the analysis of the legal position set out in theCalderbank letter is different from the analysis giving rise toMorris' success. Moreover, the letter allowed only two working daysfor consideration and did not clearly set out that an application forindemnity costs would be made in the event that the offer was rejected.In addition, the second and third defendants were still participating inthe proceeding at the time of the offer and had not consented to anydistribution of the funds in accordance with the offer, so that it wasnot capable of ending the proceeding. In these circumstances, I am notpersuaded that GoGetta unreasonably rejected the offer.
26 In relation to the Trustee, the submissions it makes, asreferred to above, are a complete answer to the application by GoGettafor an order for costs against it. There is no proper basis for thecontention by GoGetta that the Trustee should pay any of GoGetta'scosts.
27 Accordingly, the orders of the Court will be:
(a) the following sum be paid from Common Fund No. 1 and debited toAccount No. 79413:
(i) to the plaintiff the sum of $155,699.60;
(ii) to the fourth defendant an amount equal to the balance of theAccount but subject to the retention of a sum sufficient to cover anytaxation liability;
(b) Upon payment of sums equivalent to the balance of the saidAccount, in accordance with paragraph (a), there also be paid to thefourth defendant from Common Fund No. 1 and debited to Account No 10, anamount equivalent to interest accrued on the balance of account No.79413 from 1 June 2017 at the rate last fixed in respect of Common FundNo. 1.
(c) otherwise, there is no order as to the costs of the plaintiff,the third defendant or the fourth defendant.

peterhouse,Peterhouse Teacher in Court for Fondling Pupil,"A 33-year-old Peterhouse school teacher appeared in court for allegedly fondling a Form Four female pupil at the school last week.
The teacher (name withheld to protect identity of the victim), denied the allegations and magistrate Mr Liberty Garakara postponed the matter to April 4 for continuation of trial.
The teacher is out of custody.
Prosecuting, Mr Augustine Mugari told the court that sometime in August last year at around 11am, the complainant and her cousin went to Peterhouse boys IT Lab to study, but found the door locked.
She then proceeded to the accused person's office to collect the keys and when she entered, the accused told her that she had a beautiful body.
He allegedly drew closer to her and fondled her breasts and hips.
The complainant told the accused person to stop it, but instead he forcefully kissed her on the lips.
The complainant then got out of the office and went to the lab, but did not tell anyone.
On the second count, on an unknown date in August last year, the complainant was in the lab studying with her cousin when she failed to print some things and went to the accused's office for assistance.
When she entered the office, the accused complemented her on her dressing and told her to turn around, but she refused.
He allegedly stood up from where he was seated and went to where the complainant was standing, got hold of her shoulders, forced her to turn around and closed the door.
He then got behind the complainant and started fondling her breasts before forcing her to touch his manhood.
The complainant threatened to scream, but the accused was not moved.
The accused only stopped fondling the pupil when they heard a knock on the door.
He then told the complainant that he was going to have sexual intercourse with her next year when she will be in Form Five.
The teacher then told the complainant not to disclose the matter to anyone because he was afraid of losing his job.
The matter came to light on January 27 this year when the complainant told her mother (name withheld) who then went and made a report to Peterhouse Boys High School where it was deliberated, leading to school authorities making a report to the police.",1
banca imi s.p.a.,"UPDATE 1-U.S. SEC fines Cantor, BMO Capital Markets over improper handling of ADRs","(Adds context on past ADR SEC actions and expert quote)By Lawrence DelevingneWASHINGTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday said Cantor Fitzgerald & Co and BMO Capital Markets had agreed to pay $647,000 and $3.9 million respectively to settle charges of improper handling of ""pre-released"" American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).With the latest actions, the SEC has charged 13 financial institutions in its ongoing investigation into abusive ADR practices, which has so far led to more than $427 million in monetary settlements.Previous settlements with banks and brokers since 2017 include JPMorgan Chase & Co. ($135 million), U.S. subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank AG ($74 million), Banca IMI Securities ($35 million) and Wedbush Securities Inc. ($8 million).Cantor Fitzgerald and BMO obtained pre-released ADRs indirectly from other broker-dealers when ""they should have known that the pre-release transactions were not backed by foreign shares,"" according to the SEC.ADR CRACKDOWNThe multi-year SEC effort has aimed to clean up common abuses related to the use of ""pre-release"" ADRs.ADRs are U.S. traded securities that represent shares of foreign-listed companies. To ensure that the price of the U.S. shares match those abroad, banks and brokers who deal in ADRs are required to hold a corresponding amount of foreign stock, or ensure that their counterparties or clients do the same.Because of slight differences is international trade settlement times, ADRs are allowed to be ""pre-released"" to close any gap, usually less than a few days. That's where, according to the SEC, banks and brokers flouted the requirement to hold enough foreign shares, creating an undue surplus.The offending banks and brokers unjustly profited from trafficking in those phantom shares, according to the SEC. The pre-release shares were sometimes used for abusive practices, according to the SEC, such as ""naked"" short selling - betting against a company without actually borrowing shares - and an international tax dodge technique known as dividend arbitrage.""This is a big win for investors,"" said Norm Champ, a senior partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP and former director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management.""These cases continue Chairman Clayton’s efforts to maintain U.S. markets as the best in the world by rooting out practices that contribute to mispricing of publicly traded securities.""(Reporting by Lawrence Delevingne and Michelle Price Editing by Tom Brown and Cynthia Osterman)",1
cobham plc,Cobham To Pay GBP70 Million To Settle EU Dispute Over UK Tax Regime,"LONDON (Alliance News) - Aerospace and defence company Cobham PLC on Wednesday said it will make a one-off tax payment after an agreement with UK tax collector HMRC.
Cobham will book a net payment of GBP55 million, as well as interest of GBP14 million, to settle the matter with the taxman. This is within amounts previously set aside for any settlement, it said.
Cobham also may have to pay up to GBP60 million of tax related to European Commission State Aid investigations.
The EC in April decided the UK government's controlled foreign company regime partially equates to disallowed state aid, with the UK government yet to decide how it will recover this.
It is a second one-off settlement for Cobham since the start of 2019. In February, Cobham agreed to pay GBP86 million to US aircraft maker Boeing Co, and book GBP74 million of further costs, in a disagreement over the US KC-46 refuelling tanker programme.
Shares were 0.7% higher on Wednesday at a price of 114.40 pence each.",1

rizal commercial banking corp.,"RCBC brass innocent of laundering charges, bank says [Utilities Middle East (United Arab Emirates)] | RCBC brass innocent of laundering charges, bank says [Governance, Risk & Compliance Monitor Worldwide]","Four of the five Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. officials who were recently charged in court in relation to the $81-million money laundering scandal in 2016 did not deserve such an indictment.
This was according to RCBC, citing its own investigation which concluded that four of these people had no knowledge of the alleged money laundering activities.
While we expect the case to be resolved favorably, the bank cannot give further comments on the case without risking subjudice, RCBC said in a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The following officials were charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday at the Makati City Regional Trial Court: former RCBC treasurer Raul Victor Tan (who resigned in April 2016); national sales director Ismael Reyes; regional sales director Brigitte Capita; customer services head Romualdo Agarrado; and former senior customer relationship officer Angela Ruth Torres.
The DOJ found these five people remiss in their duties that, in turn, allowed the $81 million stolen by cyberhackers from the Bangladesh Bank to enter the local financial system through RCBCs Jupiter Street branch in Makati City and disappear into local casinos.
These five were found instrumental in the lifting of the temporary hold on the four beneficiary accounts of the remittance of funds from the Bangladesh Bank, and the withdrawal of such funds, among other acts.
Before this 2016 scandal, casinos were not covered by the stringent reporting obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
RCBCs disclosure did not say which of the four officials had no knowledge of the alleged money laundering. Back in 2016, the bank had tagged RCBC Jupiter as a rogue branch and the branch manager, Maia Deguito, had already been convicted of eight counts of money laundering by the Makati RTC in January.
But while RCBC did not say which one had knowledge of the money laundering transaction, back in 2016, it had fired Angela Ruth Torres along with Deguito, citing violations of bank policies and procedures as well as falsification of commercial documents.
RCBC earlier claimed that Deguito and Torres had breached the rules and facilitated the alleged laundering of funds stolen from Bangladeshi central bank.",1
rbc capital markets llc,National and MBIA Insurance File Lawsuit Against Wall Street Banks for Misconduct as Underwriters in Puerto Rico's Fiscal Crisis - Case seeks to hold major banks accountable for inequitable conduct in municipal bond market | National and MBIA Insurance File Lawsuit Against Wall Street Banks for Misconduct as Underwriters in Puerto Rico's Fiscal Crisis - Case seeks to hold major banks accountable for inequitable conduct in municipal bond market,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- Today, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation and MBIA Insurance Corporation (collectively, ""National"" or ""Plaintiffs"") filed suit in the Court of First Instance, Superior Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, against eight major Wall Street banks to hold them accountable for inequitable conduct in Puerto Rico's municipal bond market that contributed to Puerto Rico's economic collapse. 
Plaintiffs are bond insurers that have been presented with, and fully honored, over a billion dollars in claims after the municipal debt underwritten by the banks became unsustainable on their terms for the Commonwealth and its agencies and they defaulted on their obligations. The lawsuit names as defendants UBS Financial Services, Inc.; UBS Securities LLC; Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC; J.P. Morgan Securities LLC; Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.; RBC Capital Markets LLC; and Santander Securities LLC. 
Each bank underwrote one or more bonds issued by each of the Commonwealth, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority, and the Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation. The Complaint alleges that, for over a decade, these banks urged Puerto Rico and its agencies to issue massive amounts of this debt, allowing the banks to profit from underwriting and selling the bonds, as well as from related interest rate swap, refinancing and other transactions. In their capacity as underwriters, the banks had a fundamental 'gatekeeper' responsibility that assured the markets that these municipal bonds could be repaid. But, as shown by a Special Investigation Report prepared for Puerto Rico's Financial Oversight and Management Board, the banks did not conduct appropriate due diligence, resulting in key disclosures being materially false or misleading. These diligence failures concealed essential facts that would have demonstrated that the debt was not sustainable and could not be repaid in accordance with its terms.
This debt burden ultimately forced the Commonwealth from the municipal markets, leaving it and its public institutions—like power utilities, hospitals, schools, and essential infrastructure on which millions of Puerto Ricans rely—in financial distress. Bond insurers like National have paid billions of dollars in claims payments to date, while uninsured municipal bond investors, including many Puerto Ricans, have suffered huge losses.
""We are honored to represent National in this litigation,"" said Philippe Selendy, founding partner of Selendy & Gay, counsel for National and former lead counsel for the Federal Housing Finance Agency in its RMBS litigations. ""As alleged in the Complaint: 'El legado de la conducta injusta de los bancos afectará a Puerto Rico por generacione. Éstos no solo desatendieron su obligación de actuar como celosos guardianes, sino que se aprovecharon de las circunstancias imperantes en Puerto Rico, llevando a Puerto Rico directamente a su crisis actual. Mientras los bancos se enriquecían, le infligían graves daños al Gobierno de Puerto Rico y a sus ciudadanos, al igual que a National. Deben por tanto responder por esta conducta ilícita.'""[i] [English translations have been made available in the endnotes]. 
The Complaint is based upon two equitable doctrines of Puerto Rican law—doctrina de actos propios and declaración unilateral de la voluntad. 
According to Federico Hernández Denton, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and counsel for National, ""The Complaint alleges: '[L]os Demandados, por medio de sus actos, le garantizaron a los demandantes que habían realizado investigaciones completas y razonables de los términos de los bonos que los demandantes aseguraron, y éstos de buena fe confiaron en dichas representaciones, al emitir sus seguros. Pero los Demandados frustraron las expectativas legítimas y de buena fe de los demandantes, al no llevar a cabo esas investigaciones y en torno a la veracidad y de las representaciones que hicieron en las solicitudes de seguro….Estas circunstancias extraordinarias ameritan que se aplique la doctrina de actos propios y/o de declaración unilateral de la voluntad.'""[ii]
In the face of the bonds' defaults, National has paid every cent of every claim on its policies—over a billion dollars—to cover the losses of insured investors.
""Just like the Commonwealth, and the people of Puerto Rico, National was misled by the underwriters of the Commonwealth's bonds,"" said Bill Fallon, CEO of MBIA Inc., the parent company of the Plaintiffs. 
""This time of turmoil should be the occasion for rebuilding. National insured its first Puerto Rico government bond more than 30 years ago and to date has insured more than $15.7 billion of debt for Puerto Rico issuers,"" Fallon added. ""Our insurance has helped Puerto Rico raise the money to build schools and hospitals and other vital public services. We're proud of that. The future of Puerto Rico and the integrity and transparency of the capital markets demand that the underwriters be held accountable.""
Philippe Selendy, awarded ""Litigator of the Year, Grand Prize"" by The American Lawyer, has recovered over $35 billion for his public and private clients. Lauded by the Financial Times as ""The Man Who Took on Wall Street,"" AmLaw reported that the Federal Housing Finance Agency ""hit the jackpot"" when it hired Mr. Selendy to lead its ""litigation assault on Wall Street"" that recovered billions for taxpayers in the aftermath of the Great Recession. 
Retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, Federico Hernández Denton has over 50 years of expertise in law practice and litigation. He was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (2004-2014), when he retired from the Court after presiding the Judicial Branch of Puerto Rico. Upon his retirement, he was appointed by the U.S. District Court of Puerto Rico as a Constitutional Lawyer of the Monitor of the Puerto Rico Police Commission.
MBIA Inc., headquartered in Purchase, New York is a holding company whose subsidiaries provide financial guarantee insurance for the public and structured finance markets.
National Public Finance Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA Inc. and independently capitalized with $3.8 billion in claims-paying resources as of June 30, 2019.
The Complaint is available here.
[i] ""'The legacy of the banks' unjust conduct will affect Puerto Rico for generations. The banks not only disregarded their gatekeeping role but exploited it, leading Puerto Rico straight into its current crisis. While the banks enriched themselves, they caused great damage to the Commonwealth, its people, and National. They should now bear the costs of their inequitable conduct.'""
[ii] ""'Defendants through their acts assured National that they were conducting reasonable investigations regarding the terms of the bonds that National insured, and National relied on those acts in issuing its insurance. But Defendants frustrated National's legitimate, good faith expectations by choosing not to conduct those investigations and utterly failing to ensure that they had confirmed the truthfulness and completeness of the integral materials in the insurance applications….These extraordinary circumstances warrant application of doctrina de actos propios and/or the unilateral declaration of will.'""

lothian pension fund,Lothians pension pot has £85m in arms firms linked to Middle East ‘dirty war’,"COUNCIL workers in the Lothians have more than £85m of their pension fund invested in arms firms linked to a brutal civil war in the Middle East.
The Lothians fund has more money tied up with company’s selling arms to Saudi Arabia than any other UK pension pot.
Campaigners will next week bring a judicial review to the Court of Appeal into the legality of UK arms exports to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen’s conflict.
Kate Nevens from Edinburgh Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “It’s shocking that Lothian Pension Fund is investing so much money in companies that are playing a central role in the bombardment and destruction of Yemen.
“It is using our city’s money to profit from war, and supporting companies whose weapons are implicated in war crimes.  
“Public money should be used for the public good. The fund should set a positive precedent by investing in areas like renewable energy, and proactively engaging with industries that are part of creating the positive changes we want to see in the world.”
The Lothian Pension Fund is responsible for investing the retirement plans - collectively worth £7.8 billion - of local government and public body workers in the region.
Figures obtained under freedom of information laws showed the fund has £85.2m invested in arms firms.
The investments account for just over one percent of its total investments and earned the fund £3.8m last year.
US security giant Lockheed Martin accounts for the majority of Lothian Pension Fund’s investments in arms firms - with 282,787 shares worth £69.7 million.
The Maryland-based multinational, with offices in London, is one of two companies that build the GBU-12 Paveway II missile.
Shrapnel fragments found at the site where 40 children on a school bus were killed in Yemen last August by a Saudi warplane were reportedly traced back to the US company.
The fund also has 34,000 shares in fellow US firm Northrop Grumman - worth £7.8 million.
Its website states the firm is “heavily involved in the training and development of the Saudi military personnel, most notably providing technical services for the ministry of the national guard.”
Virginia-based Northrop Grumman’s portfolio includes combat aircraft including the ground-attack A-10 “tank buster”  and the B-2 Spirit “stealth” bomber.
It also manufactures a wide range of military drones, including the Global Hawk which is used in surveillance and targeting.
Third on the list is Raytheon in which Lothian Pension Fund has 50,400 shares worth £7.7 million.
Massachusetts-based Raytheon also makes Paveway missiles at a factory in Glenrothes, Fife.
Shards of bombs found at several sites where Yemeni civilians died have been traced back to the US-based company, according to American network CNN.
Nearly 10,000 men, women and children, mostly civilians have been killed in Yemen’s civil war which has raged for more than three years.
Survivors have been pushed to the brink of starvation while outbreaks of diseases including cholera have created a humanitarian catastrophe.
The carnage is often referred to as a hidden war as it plays out away from the gaze of the international community.
Next Tuesday the Court of Appeal in London will begin to hear a three-day an appeal brought by Campaign Against Arms Trade.
It seeks to overturn a 2017 High Court judgment which allows the UK Government to continue to export arms to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen.
In May last year, CAAT was given permission to appeal against the original verdict.
This followed a hearing in front of two Court of Appeal judges, Lord Justice Irwin and Lord Justice Flaux.
CAAT’s legal team will argue that the decision to grant the licences was against UK arms export policy.
Campaigners argue a ‘clear risk’ exists that the arms might be used in ‘a serious violation of International Humanitarian Law’.
But the UK government claims to operate “one of the most robust arms export control regimes in the world”.
As set out in the claim, a range of international organisations including a UN Panel of Experts, the European Parliament and many humanitarian NGOs, have condemned the ongoing Saudi air strikes against Yemen as unlawful. The violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) found by the bodies listed include:
Investments by Lothian Pension Fund have sparked controversy before, with cross-party city councillors urging a move away from fossil fuel fims last June.
And in 2017, the Evening News reported how the fund had invested £46 million into fracking firms.
The Lothian Pension Fund declined to comment on specific investments but its website sets out its policy.
It states: “Lothian Pension Fund has a fiduciary duty to its members and employers, set out in law, to invest for the best returns to ensure pensions can be paid when they are due.
“This restricts disinvesting from companies for purely non-financial reasons.
“However, the Fund believes strongly that environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues affect the financial performance of the companies in which it invests.
“It has a long history of taking these ESG issues seriously and, where appropriate, acting upon them.”",1

rolls-royce plc,CBI books Rolls Royce in corruption case worth Rs 77 crore [New Indian Express (India)],"NEW DELHI: The CBI has booked London-based Rolls Royce in a corruption case for allegedly paying over Rs 77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from public sector undertakings HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11, officials said Tuesday.
The action comes after a five-year-long inquiry by the agency initiated on the basis of a complaint from the Defence Ministry which had received a letter about the engagement of Singapore-based Ashok Patni and his company Aashmore Pvt Ltd by Rolls Royce, they said.
ALSO READ: CBI grills bank officials in Sterling Biotech case
The inquiry was launched on the basis of the letter which was forwarded to the CBI.
There was no immediate response from Rolls Royce.
It was alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around Rs 4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce paid Rs 18 crore to Patni as ""commercial advisor"" in the 100 supply orders of Avon and Allison Engines spare parts to HAL between 2007-11, they alleged.
The agency alleged that Patni was also engaged in direct contracts of Rolls Royce with ONGC and GAIL for the supply of spare parts.

Although contracts with ONGC and GAIL allowed services of an agent but it was mandatory to declare the name at the time of bidding, a condition violated by Rolls Royce, they said.
The company declared the name of its agent to the oil and gas sector behemoths in 2013, the agency alleged.
It is alleged that Roll Royce paid Rs 29.81 crore in 73 purchase orders from 2007 to 2011 for procurement of material and spare parts pertaining to the engines for ONGC, but the company declared it in 2013, they alleged.
The company also paid one million British pounds with regard to 68 purchase orders from GAIL for spare parts from 2007 to 2010, the CBI alleged.

It also said that the company entered in an arrangement with Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd and another company Infinity, also owned by Patni, to which extra commission was paid, but not declared to GAIL, it alleged.
The total commission paid by Rolls Royce comes to the tune of Rs 28.09 crore during the period 2007-10 for supplies to GAIL, they alleged.
Rolls Royce, its Indian subsidiary, Patni, his company and Mumbai-based Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd besides unidentified officials of HAL, ONGC and GAIL have been booked by the CBI for criminal conspiracy and bribery, they said.
There was an alleged conspiracy by Rolls Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls Royce India Pvt Ltd to misrepresent the facts before HAL regarding the engagement of the agent in order to win contracts with HAL with ""deception"", they said.
The Indian Marine Gas Turbine unit of the HAL provides support in areas of inspection, spare parts, maintenance, equipment overhaul and assembly for Industrial and Marine Gas Turbines under licence from reputed manufactures.
The unit provides overhaul and repair of Avon and Allison Engines for ONGC and GAIL for which spare parts are supplied by energy division of Rolls Royce, they said.
The contract between Rolls Royce Power Engineering Plc . and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. was signed June, 2007 which was valid till December, 2011 to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the units owned by the GAIL and ONGC under above licence from Rolls Royce.
""The purchase order condition specifically mentioned that Rolls Royce is not supposed to appoint any agent in India to promote this contract and no commission is payable to such agent,"" the CBI FIR has alleged.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce violated the condition of purchase order and integrity pact by engaging Patni and his company as commercial advisor from 2007 to 2011 and paid a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 11.3 per cent for supply of spare parts of Avon and Allison Engines.
The commission amount comes to the tune of Rs 18.32 crore during the period from 2007 to 2011 for 100 purchase order, they alleged.",1

                JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED ON                      :      20th JUNE, 2019


JUDGMENT :



This appeal is directed by original opponent No.2 against the judgment and award dated 5 th May, 2012, passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Nanded (""Tribunal"", for short) in Motor Accident Claims Petition No.950 of 2008. Respondent Nos.1 to 6 are original claimants and respondent No.7 is original opponent No.1, who is owner of the offending vehicle.


2. The facts leading to institution of this appeal are that on 31st October, 2008, at about 7.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m., when deceased Abdul Razak was walking by Mudkhed-Jamb road, the offending Bajaj Auto bearing registration No.MH-26/G-0522 gave dash to the deceased 3 fa1366-2012 near Nisarg dhaba, resulting into his death on the spot. The accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving by driver of the offending vehicle. Therefore, the claimants filed claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, claiming compensation of Rs.6,00,000/- form the opponents.


3. Opponent No.1 - owner of the offending vehicle did not file written statement. However, opponent No.2


- insurer of the offending vehicle controverted the claim petition by denying involvement of the offending vehicle and occurrence of the accident due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending vehicle. Statutory defence was also taken regarding breach of condition of policy of the insurance for the reason of not holding valid and effective driving licence by the driver of the offending vehicle.


4. After considering the evidence placed on record, the Tribunal held that on the date of accident, driver of the offending vehicle did not hold valid and effective driving licence and thereby opponent No.1 committed breach of condition of policy of the insurance. However, the Tribunal awarded compensation of 4 fa1366-2012 Rs.3,65,000/- and fastened the liability against opponent No.1, but directed the insurer of the offending vehicle to pay that compensation to the claimants and to recover it from opponent No.1/owner.


5. Heard Shri V.N. Upadhye, learned counsel for the appellant - insurer and Shri H.I. Pathan, learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 6 - claimants. None appeared for respondent No.7 - owner.


6. Learned counsel for the insurer submits that after occurrence of the accident, FIR (Exh-29) was lodged against unknown vehicle and subsequently, on 26 th November, 2008, when the supplementary statement of the informant, the offending vehicle was involved in the abovesaid accident. He submits that even the person who lodged FIR and involved the offending vehicle in his supplementary statement on hearsay information, is not examined by the claimants.


7. Next contention of learned counsel for the insurer is that even the Investigating Officer is not examined to ascertain the source of information received by the informant on the basis of which the offending 5 fa1366-2012 vehicle was involved. The sum and substance of argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant is that despite total lack of evidence, the Tribunal erroneously held that the offending vehicle was involved in the abovesaid incident and directed the insurer to pay compensation to the claimants. He placed reliance on ""Anil and others Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. and others"" (2018 STPL 1205 SC), wherein the Apex Court exonerated insurer from its liability to pay compensation after appreciating the evidence placed on record in that particular case. The learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in the case of ""Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Manisha w/o Lahu Kale and others"", decided on 4th September, 2018 in First Appeal No.2742 of 2015, wherein this Court held that the rules under the Evidence Act are not strictly applicable, initial burden of proof lies on the claimant to prove his contention on the basis of preponderance of probability and the Tribunal cannot forget basic principles of establishing the liability and the quantum of compensation payable. In that case, this Court also held that only because the owner and driver did not contest the claim does not mean that involvement of offending vehicle is prima facie 6 fa1366-2012 established by the claimants to discharge their initial burden. This Court held that there should be sufficient material on record to prove the involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident for fastening the liability against the owner and insurer of the offending vehicle. Similar view was also taken by this Court in First Appeal No. 2973 of 2013 (New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Laxman s/o Dadarao Karpe and others), decided on 28th July, 2015, First Appeal No.1535 of 2013 (M/s Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Narayan s/o Nivrutti Bembde and others) decided on 23rd January, 2014, First Appeal No.2829 of 2015 (New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Ashalata Suryakant Patil and others), decided on 4th October, 2018. In First Appeal No.3333 of 2015 (M/s I.C.I.C.I. Lombard Insurance Company Ltd., Mumbai Vs. Janabai wd/o Dinkarrao Ghorpade and others), decided by this Court on 14th December, 2018, this Court has taken view that only because police filed criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle, the involvement of that vehicle is not proved.


8. Learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 6 - claimants submits that in supplementary statement, the 7 fa1366-2012 informant had given the name of the driver and registration number of the offending vehicle. He submits that filing of the chargesheet by police against the driver is sufficient to prove involvement of the offending vehicle in the abovesaid accident. He supported the impugned judgment and order.


9. In the case at hand, the finding of the Tribunal that at the time of accident, driver of the offending vehicle did not hold valid and effective driving licence is not challenged either by opponent No.1 or by the claimants. Therefore, that point need not be reconsidered in the present appeal.


10. However, after going through the record and proceedings, it emerges that to discharge the initial burden of proof, which lies on the claimants, the claimants have examined only Hajratbee Abdul Razak (PW1), who is neither eye witness of the occurrence, nor the informant who lodged FIR. From her evidence, it emerges that she does not know even the registration number of the vehicle, which gave dash to the deceased. Though in her cross-examination, involvement of the offending vehicle is specifically denied by the learned 8 fa1366-2012 counsel for the insurer, the Tribunal erroneously observed that such version of Hajratbee Abdul Razak (PW1) was not challenged. In view of the above admission given by Hajratbee Abdul Razak (PW1), her evidence is of no help to prove the involvement of the offending vehicle.


11. In the case at hand, from the police papers placed on record i.e. FIR (Exh-29), spot panchanama (Exh-31) and inquest panchanama (Exh-33), it emerges that accident occurred on 31st October, 2008 and FIR was lodged on 1st November, 2008 i.e. within reasonable period. However, in the FIR (Exh-29), the offending vehicle was not involved. On the other hand, it is specifically mentioned in the FIR (Exh-29) that unknown vehicle gave dash to the deceased when he was walking by the road. This FIR was lodged by Abdul Karim Mehtabsab Bagwan. However, this informant is not examined by the claimants atleast to prove his supplementary statement recorded on 26th November, 2010 wherein for the first time, the informant stated before the police regarding involvement of the offending vehicle and name of the driver. The learned Tribunal, though exhibited this supplementary statement (Exh-30), the same cannot be 9 fa1366-2012 read in evidence in absence of evidence of Abdul Karim Mehtabsab Bagwan or the Investigating Officer. Otherwise also, Osman Mohd. Bagwan, who provided information to Abdul Bagwan - the informant regarding involvement of the offending vehicle, is not examined by the claimants. Thus, absolutely, no material is available on record to prove involvement of the offending vehicle in the abovesaid accident. As already held by this Court, mere filing of chargesheet against the driver of the offending vehicle, is not sufficient to prove the involvement of the offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident.


12. In view of above discussion, though learned counsel for the claimants supported the judgment passed by the Tribunal on the basis of copies of police papers on record, for the reasons stated above, the contention of learned counsel for the claimants is not acceptable. Accordingly, my conclusion is that the claimants miserably failed to prove involvement of the offending vehicle in the abovesaid accident and therefore, no liability can be fastened against either opponent No.1 or against opponent No.2. The claim petition for compensation deserves to be dismissed.


10 fa1366-2012


13. In the result, First Appeal No.1366 of 2012 is allowed. The judgment and award passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Nanded in Motor Accident Claims Petition No.950 of 2008 is set aside and Motor Accident Claims Petition No.950 of 2008 is dismissed.


14. If any compensation amount deposited by the appellant/insurer is already withdrawn by the claimants, the same shall be re-deposited by the claimants and it be refunded to the appellant/insurer of the offending vehicle.


15. The balance compensation amount lying in this Court be refunded to the appellant/insurer after the appeal period is over.


16. The parties to bear their respective costs of the appeal.

Reportedly, this lawsuit is filed by a number of shareholders. The claim is for a total amount of DKK11,785,192,218 based on their trading and holding of shares in Novo Nordisk A/S during the period 3 February 2015 to 2 February 2017.
According to the company, this lawsuit alleges that Novo Nordisk made misleading statements and did not make appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the US.

"etsy, inc.","California U.S. Attorney: Santa Barbara County Man Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud in Investment Fraud Schemes That Promised Facebook, Twitter Stock | SANTA BARBARA COUNTY MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO WIRE FRAUD IN INVESTMENT FRAUD SCHEMES THAT PROMISED FACEBOOK, TWITTER STOCK [U.S. Fed News]","LOS ANGELES, California, June 3 -- The office of the U.S. Attorney for Central District of California issued the following news release:
A Montecito man pleaded guilty today to one felony count of wire fraud for defrauding investors by making false promises to use their money purchase shares of Facebook and Twitter prior to the companies' initial public offerings.
Efstratios ""Elias"" Argyropoulos, 72, entered his plea before United States District Judge George Wu, who scheduled an August 26 sentencing hearing. Argyropoulos faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
As he admitted in his plea agreement, between October 2010 and October 2015, Argyropoulos operated Prima Ventures Corporation, a Santa Barbara-based financial services firm of which he was the president and sole shareholder. Argyropoulos represented to investors that he had access to ""amazing"" investment opportunities that would provide a high rate of return on any money invested, court papers state.
Argyropoulos misrepresented to investors that he would pool their money to purchase pre-initial public offering shares of companies such as Facebook and Twitter, according to court documents. Argyropoulos also falsely told investors he had access to good investment opportunities in companies such as Alibaba, Etsy, and E-Waste, the plea agreement states. As he admitted, Argyropoulos also represented that he and Prima were licensed brokers, when in truth, neither he nor Prima was licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority to sell securities. Instead of purchasing the stocks, Argyropoulos diverted the investor funds for other uses, such as day-trading in stocks unrelated to the promised investments, and personal expenses, such as landscaping, utilities, and his legal expenses arising out of an investigation into his activities conducted by the SEC, the plea agreement states.
Argyropoulos, who was charged in a 21-count federal grand jury indictment last year, admitted to causing at least $1,495,657 in uncompensated losses in connection with his schemes to defraud.
Argyropoulos also admitted to willfully violating a January 2015 court order in a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was based on the fraudulent Facebook and Twitter scheme. The injunction prohibited Argyropoulos from selling fraudulent investments and acting as an unlicensed broker.
The case against Argyropoulos was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Scott Paetty and Adam Schleifer of the Major Frauds Section.",0

starline s.p.a.,CCSO questions $3.2M in PSA transactions,"Sheriff's office investigators believe the embezzlement at the Camden County Public Service Authority involves as much as $3.2 million in missing or misappropriated public funds, including about $170,000 in purchases supporting the former director's hobby of collecting classic cars.
He and three others were arrested last week on felonies related to the PSA investigation. The Tribune & Georgian filed an open records request last week for documents relating to the arrest warrants, including a supporting affidavit that provides details about the alleged crimes at the PSA.
Personal use of a PSA credit card, fictitious grants to an outside agency and purchase reimbursements were a few of the ""schemes"" that were employed to funnel public money from the PSA into the hands of a few, according to a supporting affidavit filed by Camden County Sheriff's Office investigators with four arrest warrants last week. Four charged
The CCSO served arrest warrants on PSA director William Brunson last week, in addition to three others that investigators believe are related to the case - former assistant PSA director Shawnta Jenkins and the former county chief financial officer Mike Fender and his wife Caroline Fender, who operate a private school.
When financial problems were discovered at the PSA last May, the PSA board of directors fired Brunson and Jenkins for violating their fiduciary duties. Days later, Brunson was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of theft for allegedly stealing a total of $38,500 in government funds.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation stated at the time of the arrest that the criminal investigation into the PSA's financial irregularities was ongoing. However, the state agency turned over its case to the district attorney near the end of the year without making any additional arrests.
The CCSO then picked up the case, which resulted in last week's arrests. All four are facing charges of conspiracy to defraud the state or political subdivision, conspiracy to commit a crime and theft by deception.
Brunson also has been charged with additional counts, including financial transaction card fraud and criminal receipt of stolen goods.
Adding it up
A press release issued after last week's arrests said investigators reviewed a forensic audit and ""discovered that $1.7 million in questionable transactions were unaccounted for after the GBI investigation was concluded,"" the news release said. ""After reviewing the audit, Sheriff Jim Proctor assigned sheriff's office investigators to conduct an additional investigation concerning the disappearance of the unaccounted funds.""
However, the sheriff's office has added to that figure. According to Maj. Chuck Byerly who is leading the CCSO investigation, he and other investigative personnel have identified $1,073,649.05 in personal credit card purchases and unsupported purchase and mileage reimbursements at the PSA from fiscal years 2008-2018.
Brunson also allegedly neglected to pay taxes that were withheld from employees' paychecks, leading to a $1.7 million liability with the Internal Revenue Service.
Together with the $38,500 in wire transfers that Brunson had previously been charged with and $430,497 in unauthorized grants to an outside agency, the misappropriated and missing funds total $3,241,704.81.
The sheriff's office affidavit details the numerous ""schemes"" that were part of the conspiracy to defraud taxpayers.
Scheme 1 - Tin
Brunson issued a total of $220,000 in supposed reimbursement checks to himself and Jenkins during the past dozen years.
""Over the time period of FY 2006 through FY 2017, there were about 80 checks cut and cashed by Brunson and Jenkins,"" the affidavit said. ""The supporting invoices from any vendor have not been located. During subsequent interview, Jenkins admitted he was uncomfortable with issuing checks to himself and then cashing them to provide Brunson with cash. He did, however, continue the practice in furtherance of the conspiracy.""
Scheme 2 - Mileage
Brunson and Jenkins also received reimbursements for mileage for work travel on their personal vehicles, but travel forms that specified the purposes and mileage from each trip did not appear to be used, the affidavit said.
""Under the county travel policy covering travel and reimbursement, Brunson and Jenkins would have had to travel about 1.26 million miles (over 10 years) to justify those reimbursement amounts,"" said the affidavit. ""Additionally, in crossing the various schemes, (Brunson) utilized the PSA credit card for around $20,000 in gas and related purchases while he was being paid mileage.""
At a bond hearing last week, Brunson said that he is not currently employed because he is legally blind and cannot drive.
Scheme 3 - McDonald's As with other reimbursements issued to PSA employees, there were no supporting invoices or payment requests.
""None of the disbursements to Jenkins are being shown as being authorized by Brunson and disbursements to Brunson did not have any type of check request form ? During (2008 and 2009), the ?McDonald's"" scheme generated disbursements of PSA funds to Brunson of about $14,250 and disbursements of about $39,000 to Jenkins,"" the affidavit said.
Scheme 4 - Other
The affidavit said about $357,800 in checks was issued to Brunson to himself and others for unknown purposes from 2007 to 2017.
""A large portion of this category is indicated as ?reimbursement' or ?payroll reimbursement.' The ones categorized as ?reimbursement' have no documentation, vouchers, receipts, records or anything indicating what the expense was that justified a reimbursement,"" the affidavit said.
Scheme 5 - Advance ""The investigation also revealed that the former chief financial officer for Camden County, Mike Fender, and his wife, Caroline Fender, received funds in excess of $430,000 for a school, Advanced Learning Center, which is owned by the Fenders. The school funding had been disguised as a grant that did not exist,"" the sheriff's office release stated.
According to incorporation papers filed with the Georgia Secretary of State, the Fenders operated the school using two separate corporations, the for-profit Advance Learning Center and the nonprofit Advance Learning Academy. The PSA grant money was disbursed to the for-profit ALC.
In separate interviews last fall, both of the Fenders told the Tribune & Georgian that they were victims in this case and were under the impression that they were receiving legitimate grants. However, they also acknowledged that there was no competitive bid process involved in receiving those funds.
Fender was fired in November from his job as Camden County chief financial officer because he did not disclose that financial conflict of interest to his employer, according to county administrator Steve Howard.
According to the CCSO affidavit, ""(Mr. Fender) advised that the county took over payroll responsibilities from the PSA in March 2017. He stated that they (county officials) had known for years there were problems with the PSA financial system and that he told county commission chairman Jimmy Starline that ?something wasn't right.' He (Fender) said that many vendors who had done business with the PSA had not been getting paid and had been calling board members about the problem. He (Fender) states that some of the payments to individuals appeared suspicious and he equated those payments to hush money,"" the affidavit said.
The affidavit also noted that, Ms. Fender said ""there were no written memos, agreements or MOUs with PSA regarding the grant and meetings regarding the grant were conducted in an ?offline' status."" Neither of them ever met with the outside granting agency, it added.
""Despite the knowledge that it was well known that ?something wasn't right' with the PSA and their finances, despite the fact that no documentation, memos or agreements were present or even seen, despite the fact that local vendors were not getting bills paid and a variety of other indicators, the ALC continued to accept monies from the PSA and deposit it into their accounts,"" the affidavit said.
Scheme 6 - Credit card Brunson filled out an application for a credit card in the PSA's name and Brunson took control of it, using it more than 400 times and racking up almost $200,000 in charges between 2006 and 2018, according to investigators.
""A total of at least $172,000 in purchases was specifically for his hobby of collecting and selling classic automobiles,"" the affidavit said.
Brunson also used the card repeatedly to pay for auto insurance on his personal vehicle as well as the power bill at his residence, the document added. Funding sources
According to the CCSO, the investigation revealed that Brunson had stolen the funds from a PSA general expenditure account, as well as two Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) accounts.
""The SPLOST 6 and SPLOST 7 accounts were to be used by the (PSA) for future upgrades to the parks and recreation programs and properties. Over $811,000 is missing from the SPLOST 6 account, and over $128,000 is missing from the SPLOST 7 funds,"" the release added.
Documents received through an open records request show that Brunson requested a $151,000 advance on the PSA's monthly SPLOST allocation in an Aug. 21 letter to Mike Fender, saying that PSA was running ahead of schedule on projects at Chris Gilman Stadium, Howard Peeples Park and Sweetwater Park.
Fender, who was county CFO at the time, approved the advance payment of $67,000 on Aug. 24 and $84,000 on Aug. 31. The county then withheld money from the PSA's August, September, December and January SPLOST distribution to pay itself back for those funds.
By the time Brunson and Jenkins were removed and accountants could sort out the authority's financial situation, the PSA owed more than $500,000 to the county government for payroll and unpaid invoices in 2017 and 2018 related to workers comp and health insurance for employees and insurance for the PSA's vehicles and property.
Insurance claim At the time of the arrests
last week, Camden County announced that it had recovered ""a substantial portion"" of the funds lost in the PSA fraud.
""The county's insurance provider, Travelers Insurance, has agreed to cover the maximum allowable loss of $1 million under the policy. The PSA is covered by this policy, which is paid for through a shared funds arrangement between Camden County and the PSA,"" a county press release stated.
The release credited interim HR director Mike Spiers, interim CFO Nancy Gonzalez and county attorney John Myers for their hard work in getting the funds less than a year after the claim was made.",0

KC Man Pleads Guilty to $388,000 Scrap Metal Scheme
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- A Kansas City, Missouri, man pleaded guilty in federal court today to embezzling more than $388,000 from his employer in a scheme to redeem scrap metal.
Russell R. Fotovich, 47, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Greg Kays to participating in the wire fraud conspiracy and to filing a false tax return.
By pleading guilty today, Fotovich admitted he conspired with others from April 2011 to June 2016 to redeem scrap metal belonging to his employer, DST Systems, Inc., and keep a major portion of the proceeds for themselves. Conspirators should have turned in all receipts and proceeds of the scrap redemption transactions to DST, which totaled $563,556. However, they turned in only 39 of 137 receipts, and only $174,910 of the proceeds, causing a $388,645 loss to DST.
Fotovich also pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return. Fotovich admitted he did not declare the embezzled income on federal income tax returns.
Fotovich worked at DST as a facilities engineer at the DST Winchester Data Center. (Fotovich owned two businesses apart from his DST employment -- R&T Heating and Cooling and R&T Mechanical.) When the facility underwent major renovations from 2011 through 2016, copper wire and other metals were removed and redeemed at a local scrap dealer. Fotovich and a co-conspirator conducted all but one of the 138 scrap redemptions.
Conspirators requested that the scrap dealer make checks payable to them personally rather than to DST, and that redemption tickets be split, in order to conceal the total amount of scrap redeemed. Sometimes they received as many as four receipts and corresponding checks in one day.
Conspirators requested that DST buy an industrial wire-stripping machine to improve and expedite the scrap redemption. The machine cost approximately $5,000, and allowed conspirators to receive a higher redemption value for the DST-owned scrap they sold. (Non-stripped copper wire carried a lower redemption value.) After DST purchased the wire-stripping machine in early 2014, conspirators increased their fraudulent thefts more than ten-fold.
By pleading guilty today, Fotovich agreed to forfeit to the government $138,758 (representing his proceeds of the fraud conspiracy). The court will determine the amount of restitution Fotovich must pay to DST at the sentencing hearing. Under the terms of today's plea agreement, Fotovich must pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service in an amount to be determined, of not more than $79,949 (not including interest). Fotovich also must pay restitution to the Missouri Department of Revenue in an amount to be determined, of not more than $16,209.
Under federal statutes, Fotovich is subject to a sentence of up to eight years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathleen D. Mahoney. It was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation.

county of san mateo,PG&E proposes $105 million wildfire-linked housing assistance fund | PG&E proposes $105 million wildfire-linked housing assistance fund | PG&E proposes $105 million wildfire-linked housing assistance fund | PG&E proposes $105 million wildfire-linked housing assistance fund,"May 02--     May 2--PG&E is proposing a $105 million fund for housing-related assistance for victims with ""urgent needs"" from the wildfires of 2017 and 2018, according to a bankruptcy court filing on Wednesday by the disgraced utility.
The funding planned by PG&E would be directed at people affected by the catastrophic wildfires of recent years, including a series of lethal infernos in October 2017 that scorched the North Bay Wine County and nearby regions, and a deadly blaze that tore through Butte County in November 2018 and essentially destroyed the town of Paradise.
""A program that will assist certain wildfire claimants with their alternative living expenses and other urgent needs"" was how PG&E described its proposed effort in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco.
The size of the assistance fund is expected to total as much as $105 million. The ultimate amount of funding available could drop to $100 million, depending on the amount of administrative expenses. Those administrative expenses could not exceed $5 million.
PG&E proposed the housing assistance fund in connection with its Jan. 29 bankruptcy case, which the company filed to help it ward off a forbidding mountain of liabilities and wildfire-related claims that caused the embattled utility's finances to buckle. PG&E listed $51.69 billion in debts in the bankruptcy case.
The wildfire-related fund would have to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
""The debtors propose to provide support to those wildfire claimants who have been displaced from their primary residence as a result of the 2017 and 2018 wildfires,"" PG&E said in its filing.
PG&E is a convicted felon for crimes it committed before and after a fatal gas explosion in San Bruno that killed eight people in 2010.
The company now faces an ominous set of problems in connection with the blazes of recent years, since its equipment has been directly linked to setting off multiple infernos in 2017 and 2018. Plus, the company has yet to compensate numerous victims of a fire in 2015 that roared through parts of Amador County and Calaveras County.
""Many of those who lost their homes in the 2017 and 2018 wildfires continue to struggle to find affordable alternative housing,"" PG&E said  in its request for court approval for the fund. ""Although many of the wildfire claimants expect to have the costs of substitute or temporary housing for 12 to 24 months covered through their insurance companies, others are uninsured or have exhausted their insurance.""
PG&E stated in the filing that people won't lose their rights to file claims or lodge lawsuits against PG&E if they accept the funds through the proposed program. PG&E also said its creation of the fund doesn't mean it acknowledges any legal liabilities.
Depending on the precise wording of any agreements, the proposal could be helpful, said state Sen. Jerry Hill, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County, as well as the city of San Bruno.
""If the victims retain all their rights and there are no strings attached, this could offer assistance to those who have lost everything,"" Hill said.
It's entirely possible $100 million in funds might not be enough for wildfire victims, warned Gerald Singleton, an attorney for people with fire-related claims against PG&E in connection with the Northern California infernos of recent years.
""My concern is the sheer number of people who have been affected,"" Singleton said. ""I don't know if $100 million is going to be enough.""
Singleton also pointed out that, during a recent bankruptcy case proceeding, PG&E raised the possibility of a fund to assist wildfire victims -- but also claimed that its finances would continue to totter without comprehensive reforms of policies and laws connected with wildfire liabilities.
""PG&E is using the wildfire victims as hostages or pawns,"" Singleton said. ""That is outrageous.""",0
entergy arkansas inc.,Swepco Electric Faces Challenges at PSC and in Federal Court,"Energy
Southwest Electric Power Co. of Shreveport is facing legal and environmental pressure on two fronts, with the Sierra Club filing a Public Service Commission request to force a resubmission of the utility's 20-year resource plan and the city of Prescott suing it for $3.3 million over what the city sees as excessive power transmission charges.
Sierra Club filed a docket intervention request with the PSC asking it to force Swepco, which has 120,000 Arkansas customers, to analyze the economic value of its coal-burning Dolet Hills generation plant near Mansfield, Louisiana.
The environmental group has repeatedly raised concerns about the economic viability of the Dolet Hills power station, suggesting that its continued operation may actually be costing Swepco customers money. Swepco is a subsidiary of heavily coal-dependant American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio.
The suit filed by Prescott, d.b.a. the Prescott Water & Light Co., alleges in U.S. District Court in Texarkana that the utility engaged in misconduct leading to additional costs of $700,000 a year to Prescott's 1,700 electricity customers through an accumulation of transmission fees. Those fees stemmed from a change that meant Entergy Arkansas could no longer provide the city with wholesale power. Swepco has not filed an answer but is reviewing the filing, a spokesman said. He added that the Sierra Club participated in a PSC Stakeholder Committee that evaluated the resource plan and concluded that Swepco had exceeded guidelines for ""a robust stakeholder engagement.""
""The committee encouraged Swepco to expeditiously implement the findings of the IRP [integrated resource plan] and immediately proceed with the addition of significant amounts of renewable energy, which we have done with our pending request for 1,200 megawatts of additional wind energy,"" said Peter Main of AEP. ""Not satisfied with these major steps toward more renewable energy, the Sierra Club continues its efforts to undermine other resources serving our customers.""
Glen Hooks, Arkansas Chapter director for the Sierra Club, said that while Swepco ""is ignoring the costs and value of the Dolet Hills plant,"" the plant's coowner, Cleco Holdings, has announced it will operate the plant only seasonally, and that the reduction in operation will save Cleco customers $40 million a year.
""If Swepco wants to keep an aging and dirty coal plant like Dolet Hills operating, the utility needs to show that the unit has value to customers,"" Hooks told Arkansas Business. ""In many places around the country, cleaner options like solar and wind power have become even less expensive than burning dirty coal.""
In the Prescott case, the city's costs for wholesale electric power soared some 10% after Entergy stopped serving the town in 2006, leading Prescott to find another source. Prescott got power from EAP until 2009, when it became a customer of Swepco.
The complaint, filed April 5 by Jim L. Julian and Mark W. Hodge of the Barber Law Firm in Little Rock and by A. Glenn Vasser of McKenzie Vasser & Barber of Prescott, said Swepco agreed to deliver power and to act as the city's agent on transmission matters in power markets.
Prescott, a town of about 3,000, said it lacked funds to build its own substation, and feared that power flowing through the town's existing Entergyowned substation would be subject to ""rate pancaking and congestion charges"" after Entergy joined a regional transmission authority in 2012. That meant power headed to town would cross through two transmission systems, Southwest Power Pool and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.
In 2014 costs rose dramatically, the suit says, and many promises by Swepco officials to address the added fees were never fulfilled.
The claims against Swepco include breach of fiduciary duty and negligence, and the suit seeks damages of $3.28 million for fees resulting from Swepco's alleged misconduct. It also asks to recover continuing damages, along with court costs and legal fees.

ritter d.o.o.,"Plea entered in court case involving death of 'beloved friend' Fritts, 26","CLINTON, Tenn. - On a cloud-filled, rainy Monday afternoon, Troy Andrew Venable of Oak Ridge, Tenn., entered a ""best interest plea"" to a charge of criminally negligent homicide regarding the October 2016 death of 26-year-old Lauren Fritts, also of Oak Ridge.
As part of Venable's plea, the 30-yearold was given a two-year sentence - but will be credited with time served in Anderson County jail and be on supervised probation.
Regardless, ""[This conviction is] going to be on your record from now on,"" Criminal Court Judge Don Elledge told Venable, who stood before the judge in the Anderson County Courthouse on Monday afternoon, along with Venable's attorney, Mike Ritter of Oak Ridge.
Deputy District Attorney General Anthony Craighead quickly read through the circumstances believed to have occurred before Fritts' lifeless body was found in the bathroom of a Tacoma Road residence late Saturday morning, Oct. 8, 2016.
An expert medical witness, according to Ritter, confirmed that Fritts had died of an acute combined overdose of alcohol and drugs. The state prosecutors had reduced the original Class D charge of reckless homicide against Venable down to the criminally negligent homicide charge, which is a lesser Class E felony.
During Monday's plea hearing it was explained that by entering the ""best interest plea,"" Venable wasn't saying he was guilty of the charge, but that he felt accepting this plea agreement was a better arrangement than having a trial and being found guilty of the charge and sentenced by the court.
District Attorney's Comments
Contacted by The Oak Ridger late Monday afternoon, District Attorney General Dave Clark of the 7th Judicial District said this was a ""mixed toxicity case."" The legal challenge in the case was that no one drug - alcohol, roxicodone or heroin - would have killed Fritts; and those three substances reportedly were obtained from three different people. And, all of that being said, the coroner also ruled Fritts' death was accidental.
Therefore, regarding the plea deal, ""I think it's all that could be done under these circumstances,"" according to DA Clark.
At the time of her death, the 26-year-old Lauren Alexandra Fritts, an Oak Ridge native, worked for the Oak Ridge Chamber of Commerce as a member and customer representative.
She had worked for the Chamber for about three years - and reportedly started as a ""temp."" Fritts was described as an ""enthusiastic young professional with just a very, very sort of anything-is possible attitude."" ""She wasn't just an associate,"" Parker Hardy, president and CEO of the Oak Ridge Chamber of Commerce, shared with The Oak Ridger immediately following Fritts' death. ""Lauren WAS Oak Ridge."" Born Aug. 5, 1990, Lauren Fritts attended St.
Mary's School and graduated in 2009 from Oak Ridge High School, where she was an acclaimed, All-State goalkeeper for the ORHS Lady Wildcats' varsity girls' soccer team.
She attended Roane State Community College and East Tennessee State University, from which she received a bachelor's degree in business administration and management.
At the time of her death, survivors included a 3-year-old son, Lauren's father Steven Fritts, her sister ""and best friend"" Leah Fritts, her mother and stepfather Janie and Chris Conner, and others.
A funeral Mass was held at the St. Mary's Catholic Church.
""I think she touched a lot of people in her personal and professional life who really loved her,"" the Chamber's Parker Hardy said at the time of Lauren Fritts' death.
In the Anderson County courtroom this Monday afternoon, Venable's grandparents and wife were there in Clinton on his behalf.
Deputy DA Anthony Craighead said - in open court on Monday - that Lauren Fritts' father was ""very upset"" about the plea deal.
Another Fritts' family member has indicated in a Facebook post that the local judicial system has failed Lauren Fritts and others in similar situations.
""Lauren, I love you and miss you every single day,"" that post states.

The Standard reported on Tuesday, September 10, that Yang had not anticipated arrest, and had instructed his assistant to negotiate with the detectives to obstruct any attempts to arrest him.
Police officers are reported to have sought an audience with Yang by posing as clients interested in purchasing property, only to pounce on him once they were let into his office at the Finance House.
Yang's company was contracted by officials in charge of the LBDA project in March 2013, 10 days after the elections, a project estimated at Ksh2.5 billion, a figure that was later inflated to over Ksh4 billion for kickbacks paid to officials, who are currently out on bail.
The Standard reported that this was not the first time Yang was brushing shoulders with the law.
He is alleged to be embroiled in a battle with Athi River Distillers, whom the company accused of improper waste disposal, leading to a pungent smell around where Greatwall Gardens, Edermann's residential project is located.
He is also said to have survived demolitions after Seefar Apartments, another of his properties, was said to have been constructed on Nairobi Dam and obstructing the course of a river.
Erdemann is reported to be locked in a bitter battle with the County Government of Nairobi, demanding Ksh200 million compensation for the perimeter wall around the apartments that the county government brought down.
The Standard also claimed that Yang is putting up 2,720 units that will rise to 34 floors on the banks of Nairobi River in Ngara, touted to be the tallest residential building in the country.
The court case is expected to generate a storm in the government as the Edermann firm is reported to be among the firms expected to deliver on president's Kenyatta's affordable house dream.",0
h.p.a.s. limited,Gregory Craig Acquitted on Charge of Lying to Justice Department,"WASHINGTON — Gregory B. Craig, one of Washington’s most prominent Democratic lawyers, was acquitted on Wednesday of a felony charge that he lied to federal authorities about work he did seven years ago for the Ukrainian government.
                  The jury returned the verdict after fewer than five hours of deliberation. It was a blow to the Justice Department’s effort to more aggressively crack down on undisclosed foreign influence in Washington as well as a vindication of Mr. Craig’s high-risk decision to face a jury and testify in his own defense.
                  The case filings exposed in detail how a foreign government was able to harness Washington’s industry of lawyers, lobbyists and public relations experts, an unflattering portrait that included at least $4 million in secret offshore bank transfers from a Ukrainian oligarch to Mr. Craig’s law firm.
                  But Mr. Craig’s guilt or innocence turned solely on the question of whether he deliberately misled Justice Department officials who were investigating whether he should register as a foreign agent.
                  The case was viewed as a test of the Justice Department’s new campaign to enforce a once-obscure foreign lobbying law. Until about two years ago, violators of the statute, known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, typically received only an administrative slap on the wrist.
                  While Mr. Craig, 74, who served as White House counsel in the first year of the Obama administration, was not accused of violating FARA, he was accused of deceiving the officials who enforce it in an effort to avoid registering as a foreign agent.
                  His was one of a series of foreign lobbying-related prosecutions that sprang from Robert S. Mueller III’s nearly two-year investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. Underscoring how the eagerness to take lucrative business from foreign interests crosses party lines, the work Mr. Craig did for Ukraine was steered to him by Paul Manafort, the longtime Republican strategist who worked closely with the Ukrainian government at the time and went on to become a key figure in the Mueller investigation.
                  The Justice Department’s focus on foreign influence cases has contributed to a wave of disclosures by lobbyists and lawyers. The number of people who have newly registered as foreign agents so far this year is more than twice the number of new registrants in all of 2010.
                  But some defense lawyers predicted Mr. Craig’s quick acquittal after a three-week trial could dampen the Justice Department’s enthusiasm for similar cases.
                  Federal prosecutors in New York have been scrutinizing the actions of at least two other well-known lobbyists who worked with Mr. Manafort on Ukraine’s behalf: Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman, and Tony Podesta, the brother of John D. Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. It is unclear where those inquiries stand and whether Mr. Craig’s acquittal might affect decisions by the prosecutors about how to proceed.
                  In Mr. Craig’s case, jurors weighed his reputation as an illustrious Washington lawyer who had served two Democratic presidents against a series of electronic communications that suggested he had shaded the truth in two letters and a meeting with Justice Department officials in 2013.
                  At that time, department officials were investigating whether Mr. Craig and his law firm had participated in a public relations campaign to help the Ukrainian government burnish its reputation. Public relations work would have prompted a requirement that Mr. Craig register as foreign agent.
                  His prosecution hinged in particular on whether he had deceived department officials by failing to disclose that he had provided a New York Times reporter with an advance copy of a report that his law firm had produced for the Ukrainian government. The reporter, David E. Sanger, and a colleague wrote an article after interviewing Mr. Craig.
                  William W. Taylor III, one of Mr. Craig’s lawyers, said that overzealous prosecutors had “hounded” his client “without any evidence and without any purpose.” He said that the Justice Department’s national security division pressed for Mr. Craig’s indictment even after federal prosecutors in New York decided the evidence did not warrant it. Before the trial started, the judge threw out one of the two counts against Mr. Craig.
                  “The question that you need to ask is not why this jury acquitted Mr. Craig, but why the Department of Justice brought this case against an innocent man in the first place,” Mr. Taylor said. “It’s a tragedy, it’s a disgrace and we are glad it is over.”
                  Mr. Craig, smiling broadly outside the courthouse, thanked the jurors, his family, his friends and his lawyers.
                  One juror, Michael G. Meyer, said that while some jurors were “very disturbed” by Mr. Craig’s conduct, “the law was presented to us in a very narrow fashion” that ruled out conviction.
                  Because the statute of limitations had run out to hold Mr. Craig accountable for any actions before October 2013, jurors were limited to considering whether he deceived federal officials during the three-month period that followed. Mr. Meyer said that four jurors switched their votes from guilty to not guilty after the panel sent a note to the judge to verify the limited time frame.
                  “Based on that very narrow thing, we couldn’t find anything he had done that warranted finding him guilty,” he said. Mr. Meyer added that Mr. Craig, in testifying in his own defense, came across as “very credible.”
                  Mr. Craig’s defense team insisted that prosecutors had concocted a charge out of a few minor omissions of facts that Mr. Craig was never under any obligation to reveal. “Mr. Craig is not the kind of person who would lie to a U.S. government agency, not after a 50-year career based on character and trust,” another of his lawyers, William Murphy, told the jurors.
                  Prosecutors said Mr. Craig gave in to hubris and self-interest, hiding the truth of his media contacts, not only from the Justice Department, but from his own firm’s general counsel. Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez, one of the prosecutors, described Mr. Craig’s final letter on the matter to the Justice Department as a “masterpiece” of lies and half-truths.
                  “If you read the letter,” he argued, “you will find contempt for the FARA unit.”
                  The FARA unit’s inquiry concerned a 2012 report that Mr. Craig and his law firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom — produced for the Ukrainian government, then led by Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Craig and his fellow lawyers were hired to review Ukraine’s prosecution of an opposition leader who had recently been sentenced to seven years in prison on corruption charges — a case that the United States and other Western nations had condemned as politically motivated. Mr. Yanukovych and his allies hoped the Skadden report would blunt criticism of the prosecution from the West.
                  The report, which earned the law firm $4.6 million, concluded that while the opposition leader’s rights had been violated at trial, her conviction was backed by evidence.
                  Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Craig concealed his role in helping Ukraine promote the report because registering as a foreign agent would have limited his prospects for further government service and damaged his reputation. They argued that he deliberately lied when he told Justice Department officials that he had responded to inquiries from reporters only to correct already published mischaracterizations of the report.
                  In fact, he had contacted Mr. Sanger, offering him an advance copy of the report and an interview about its findings two days before its publication.
                  But Mr. Craig’s lawyers described those complaints as niggling. They pointed out that federal officials kept no notes of a meeting during which Mr. Craig supposedly lied to them. They dismissed Rick Gates, one prosecution witness, as a “congenital liar” and described another key witness as a liar by trade.
                  And they questioned why, if the entire case rested on Mr. Craig’s interactions with Mr. Sanger, prosecutors never called the reporter to testify. The New York Times was expected to fight to quash any subpoena, as a matter of principle.
                  Another key witness was also missing: Prosecutors ruled out testimony from Mr. Manafort, who as a consultant to Mr. Yanukovych had commissioned Skadden’s report. Mr. Manafort, who later served as President Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, is now serving a seven and a half year prison term for fraud and other crimes, including trying to persuade witnesses against him to lie.
                  Mr. Meyer, the juror, said he was “deeply offended” by Mr. Craig’s indictment, given the breadth of other misconduct that was investigated by Mr. Mueller’s office. Although it did not initiate the case, it referred the allegations against Mr. Craig to other federal prosecutors.
                  “I could not understand why so many resources of the government were put into this when in fact actually the republic itself is at risk,” said Mr. Meyer, a specialist with a government consulting firm.
                  “This was a gnat,” he said. “How did this get to the front of the line?”

m & t andersen as,UPDATE: The KPMG cheating scandal was much more widespread than originally thought,"Record-tying $50 million fine was expected, but additional details cause experts to wonder if anything will actually
change

  A $50 million fine against KPMG LLP for its use of stolen regulatory information to cheat on audit inspections wasn't
a surprise: The Wall Street Journal warned  (https://www.wsj.com/articles/kpmg-to-pay-as-much-as-50-million-to-settle-
sec-probe-11560474967)last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission was ready to impose such a move, and the
scandal had been known about for more than a year.

  The record fine was a solid jab but no knockout punch. But then came a left hook out of nowhere.

  The SEC revealed Monday a much larger scandal than was previously known: KPMG auditors, including some senior partners
in charge of public company audits, cheated on internal tests related to mandatory ethics, integrity and compliance
training, sharing answers with other partners and staff to help them also attain passing scores. In addition, for a
period of time up to November 2015, some audit professionals, including one partner, manipulated the system for their
exams to lower the scores required to pass.

  Twenty-eight of these auditors did so on four or more occasions. Certain audit professionals lowered the required
score to the point of passing exams while answering less than 25% of the questions correctly, the SEC says.

  ""The new test-cheating scandal suddenly seems more alarming than the ongoing PCAOB 'steal the exam' scandal because
the unethical behavior went on longer and is potentially more widespread,"" Matt Kelly, editor of the Radical Compliance
newsletter and a longtime observer of corporate governance and compliance issues, told MarketWatch.

  ""There's plenty of evidence of chronic, widespread and intentional illegal behavior by senior partners including some
leading public company audits for the firm,"" Kelly said. ""And yet, prosecutors can't really impose criminal charges
against the firm.""

  Five former KPMG officials -- including its former national managing partner for audit quality and professional
practice -- and one former PCAOB official were charged last year in a case that alleged they schemed to interfere with
the PCAOB's ability to detect audit deficiencies at KPMG. The SEC said the senior KPMG partners sought and obtained
confidential PCAOB lists of inspection targets and then led a program to review and revise certain audit work papers
after the audit reports had been issued in order to reduce the likelihood of deficiencies being found during
inspections.

  Three have pleaded guilty, two were found guilty and one is still pending trial.

  The SEC's order  (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2019/34-86118.pdf)says KPMG must ""cease and desist"" violating
the securities laws and is required to evaluate its quality controls relating to ethics and integrity and identify audit
professionals that violated ethics and integrity requirements in connection with training examinations within the past
three years. KPMG must also hire an independent consultant to review and assess the firm's ethics and integrity controls
and its investigation of the cheating scandal.

  KPMG admitted the SEC's allegations. Calls to KPMG for comment were not returned.

  Largest SEC fine is small compared with other punishments

  This latest fine ties the largest ever imposed by the SEC on an audit firm, but is dwarfed by other recent fines and
settlements absorbed by audit firms with no hiccup.

  In 2003, KPMG and five of its partners -- including the head of the firm's department of professional practice -- paid
a $22 million fine in connection with the 1997-2000 audits of Xerox Corp.(XRX) . That same month, the SEC announced that
Deloitte & Touche LLP would pay $50 million -- the largest fine the SEC had ever obtained from an audit firm at that
time -- to settle charges stemming from its year 2000 audit of Adelphia Communications Corp.

  The Justice Department fined Deloitte  (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deloitte-touche-agrees-pay-1495-million-settle-
claims-arising-its-audits-failed-mortgage)$149.5 million in early 2018 for allegations of False Claims Act violations
related to its audit of bankrupt mortgage issuer Taylor Bean & Whitaker, despite no criminal complaint filed. It's one
of the largest audit-related fines, settlements or damages awards ever against an audit firm but got very little media
coverage.

  In March, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation agreed to a $335 million settlement with PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP for professional negligence claims it brought related to the audits of Colonial Bank which failed in 2009. The
settlement came after a federal judge held PwC liable for professional negligence for its audit of Colonial Bank after a
bench trial and on July 2, 2018, awarded damages of $625 million to the FDIC for its losses. PwC had said it planned to
appeal the verdict.

  Jim Peterson, a former attorney for defunct global audit firm Arthur Andersen in Europe and author of ""Count Down: The
Past, Present and Uncertain Future of the Big Four Accounting Firms,"" told MarketWatch: ""It's overdue to get the
discussion of financial fragility of the global audit firms on the table. There's no point in talking about a larger
penalty. If you made it $1 billion likely KPMG could not raise the money from its own network or outside sources.
Between the two violations, and at the scale of $50 million, it seems we are in 'too vital to kill' territory.""

  The test cheating related to a variety of subjects relevant to the professionals' audit practices, including
additional training required by a 2017 SEC enforcement action  (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/34-
81396.pdf)that charged KPMG with engaging in improper professional conduct in the audit of the financial statements of
an oil and gas client that caused reporting violations. As part of the settlement, the SEC ordered KPMG to ensure its
audit staff complete specific training programs in various technical accounting areas and to cough up the audit fees it
earned plus interest of $5.1 million.

  Will the penalty even matter?

  MarketWatch asked SEC officials on a media call if there were any more details on investigations of the impact of both
scandals on the audits of public companies. An SEC official would not provide any details about ongoing investigations
but instead directed those on the call to SEC chairman Jay Clayton's statements to the public when the ""steal the exam""
scandal broke in January 2018.

  ""Based on discussions with the SEC staff,"" Clayton wrote at the time, ""I do not believe that today's actions against
these six individuals will adversely affect the ability of SEC registrants to continue to use audit reports issued by
KPMG in filings with the Commission or for investors to rely upon those required reports.""

story/kpmg-indictment-suggests-many-who-werent-charged-knew-regulator-data-was-stolen-2018-01-23)

  ""The more details that emerge, the more difficult it is to keep believing Jay Clayton's early statements that
investors have nothing to worry about,"" said Kelly. ""The SEC has provided no details about its investigation of actual
impact on issuers, so it strains credulity to think that this egregious behavior wouldn't affect audit quality somehow.""

  ""The conduct outlined in the order is so egregious, detailing a culture which is completely unmoored from any ethical
foundation, that any company using KPMG as an auditor must ask some very serious questions about not only the quality of
the services they have received but also the very foundation of those services,"" Tom Fox, an attorney and independent
consultant who assists companies with anticorruption and antibribery compliance, wrote on his blog.  (http://
fcpacompliancereport.com/2019/06/day-reckoning-kpmg-failures-ethics/)

  ""If these partners and staff are willing to lie, cheat and steal to defy the PCAOB and the SEC, what must they be
willing to do to please clients and generate more profits?"" Fox told MarketWatch in an interview.

kpmg-turned-to-palantir-to-help-predict-which-audits-would-be-inspected-2018-06-26)

  In the 2017 case, KPMG also violated Sections 4C and 21C of the federal securities laws, which means they did not
possess ""the requisite qualifications to represent others,"" and were ""lacking in character or integrity, or to have
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct"" and ""willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the
violation of, any provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations.""

  However, in 2014 the SEC had also ordered KPMG to ""cease-and-desist"" violating the same securities laws it said it
violated in 2017 and that the firm violated again in Monday's order, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

  In the 2014 case (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/34-71389.pdf), the firm also violated Rule 102(e), which
requires auditor independence. For that it was fined $8.2 million, and also ordered, as in 2017 and in Monday's order,
to hire an independent consultant and conduct a review of its weaknesses, including developing new policies and
procedures and training to address staff knowledge deficiencies.

  KPMG also received an SEC censure each time.

  Peterson told MarketWatch that we've perhaps run out of effective penalties for the global audit firms.

Western District of Texas
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, July 31, 2019
""Camry Cruzin' Bandit"" Sentenced to 15 Years in Federal Prison for Stealing Approximately $479k from Multiple Banks
In San Antonio today, a federal judge sentenced 42-year-old Dennis Edward Stephen of San Antonio, to 15 years in federal prison for robbing multiple San Antonio banks and stealing approximately $479,000, announced U.S. Attorney John F. Bash, F.B.I. Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs, San Antonio Division, and San Antonio Police Chief William McManus.
In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Xavier Rodriguez ordered that Stephen pay $442,284 restitution and be placed on supervised release for a period of three years after completing his prison term.
""The financial industry is critical to American capitalism. Today's 15-year sentence makes clear that it ultimately doesn't pay to target banks,"" stated U.S. Attorney Bash.
On November 8, 2018, Stephen pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery. By pleading guilty, Stephen admitted responsibility for eight different bank robberies in San Antonio and the surrounding area between November 14, 2013, and July 23, 2018. The robberies include:
November 14, 2013; April 17, 2014; and September 19, 2014 -- Frost Bank on Vance Jackson Rd. -- approximately $37,604; $36,280; and $133,000 stolen, respectively;
November 24, 2015 -- Broadway Bank in Helotes, TX -- approximately $11,323 stolen;
June 16, 2016 -- Frost Bank on Wurzbach Rd. -- approximately $56,077 stolen;
November 4, 2016; July 5, 2017; and July 23, 2018 -- Frost Bank on N. Loop 1604 -- approximately $67,000; $101,000; and $36,561 stolen, respectively.
According to court records, authorities dubbed Stephen the ""Camry Cruzin' Bandit"" because he drove a Toyota Camry during his scheme and often wore the same attire while committing the robberies: blue jeans, a denim long sleeve button down shirt, a white t-shirt and a UTSA Roadrunners baseball cap covering his head, sunglasses and a surgical mask covering his face, and rubber surgical gloves covering his hands.
Authorities arrested Stephen on July 23, 2018, following the Frost Bank robbery. They were also able to recover the $36,561 he stole during that robbery. He has since remained in federal custody.
The F.B.I. together with the San Antonio Police Department investigated this case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Wannarka prosecuted this case on behalf of the Government.

greif inc,"Nicholas Sparks’ ‘The Notebook’ Gets Staged Reading Amid Controversy - The team behind the upcoming Broadway musical production has forgiven the author for his anti-LGBT emails, and now a staged reading with Vanessa Hudgens has gone ahead at Vassar.","In 1994, Nicholas Sparks was 28 and had tried a range of odd jobs: He had worked in real estate and restaurants, started an orthopedic products manufacturing business, sold an orthopedic products manufacturing business, written two rejected manuscripts, co-authored a self-help book based on the Lakota tribe of the Sioux Nation (Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding), and gotten a gig in pharmaceutical sales.
He had never published a novel. In a last-ditch effort at literary life, Sparks spent six months writing a story. It was a tale of love and loss, of two people being birds, and upholding lightly but not overtly Christian values. It was a story of marriage withstanding the test of time and Alzheimer’s. It was called The Notebook, and it made a lot of money.
Less than a year after a literary agent picked the manuscript out of her slush pile, The Notebook sold to the Time Warner Book Group for a $1 million advance. When the book was published in 1996, it hit the New York Times bestseller list in its first week and stayed there for more than a year, selling more than 105 million copies worldwide.
In 2004, the story was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, and grossing more than $115 million internationally. In the years since, The Notebook has spawned a Bollywood variation called Zindagi Tere Naam, been optioned for a series on The CW, fueled many memes, and inspired the Bengali film Niyoti, about a millionaire entrepreneur who falls for a girl with dementia.
On Sunday afternoon, the story got yet another revival—this time as a staged reading for what would become a Broadway musical, produced by Kevin McCollum and Kurt Deutsch, with a book written by playwright and This is Us producer Bekah Brunstetter, and music by “The Way I Am” singer Ingrid Michaelson. The production debuted as a staged reading at Vassar College as part of New York Stage and Film’s 35th Powerhouse season, starring James Naughton, Jelani Alladin, Hailey Kilgore, and High School Musical’s Vanessa Hudgens.
But unlike most Sparks productions, which tend to find success with the same lack of controversy on display in Sparks’ prose, the reception of this reading was uncertain. It arrived on the heels of a tense week for Sparks, after a series of emails, published by The Daily Beast, revealed the writer detailing his outrage over the alleged formation of an LGBT student group at the Epiphany School of Global Studies, a Christian academy he co-founded and helps oversee. In other messages, Sparks attributes Epiphany’s dearth of black students not to “racism or vestiges of Jim Crow” but to “1) Money and 2) Culture.”
The emails emerged as part of the discovery in a five-year lawsuit between Sparks and the former headmaster and CEO of Epiphany, Saul Hillel Benjamin, over an alleged pattern of discrimination at the school against anyone “whose religious views and/or identities did not conform to their religiously driven, bigoted preconceptions,” according to the complaint. In a message on Benjamin’s alleged leadership errors, Sparks listed Benjamin’s “misplaced priorities at the school level (GLBT, diversity, the beauty of other religions, as opposed to academic/curricular/global issues, Christian traditions, etc.).”
Shortly after the story was first published, Sparks vigorously denied the allegations in a statement on Twitter, noting that the court had dismissed many claims against him, while conceding the case is scheduled for a trial in August. (“The article appearing in today’s The Daily Beast is not news,” Sparks wrote, “and repeats false accusations and claims made against Epiphany and me, and largely ignores the overwhelming evidence we have submitted to the court.”) Four days later, he issued an apology for his language, which “potentially hurt young people and members of the LGBTQ community.” He did not address the comments he had made about black students.
Sparks’ books have earned him an ungodly sum of money, and the controversy quickly prompted calls for action from the companies and corporations helping him make it. Color of Change, an online justice non-profit that has previously campaigned for the ousting of R. Kelly, Glenn Beck, and Bill O’Reilly from RCA and FOX, respectively, launched a petition to get Sparks’ publisher, Grand Central Publishing, to drop him.
But the implications of the lawsuit were especially acute for The Notebook on Broadway, both because it related to Sparks’ most lucrative project to date—gearing up for a stage run that would assuredly earn him further millions—and because of those it involved. Unlike the vast majority of Sparks’ stories and spinoffs, the Broadway team is quite diverse, with many employees aligned with communities the author allegedly maligned. “It was very interesting that this news hit at the same time that [Sparks] is going to be working with the Broadway community,” said Liz Owen, communications director for PFLAG National, an LGBT non-profit that called for Hudgens to address the issue on Twitter.
The production appeared to represent a kind of case study in the limits of accountability activism, of what happens when one man’s behavior affects a much larger group of workers—many of whom may not have known about the suit when they took the job—and what they owe their audience, if anything at all.
After Sparks’ apology, the Notebook production issued a statement, forgiving the author for his emails. “We are encouraged that Mr. Sparks has made a strong statement of support of the LGBTQ+ community today,” it said. “The Notebook musical team has been given complete freedom to create a very new piece of art from the source material of the book and our mission for the past 3 years has been and continues to be to create a story of love and humanity that reflects our core values of diversity and inclusion.”
Like Sparks, the team did not mention race. It has elected not to discuss the issue further. Representatives for James Naughton, Jelani Alladin, Hailey Kilgore, Bekah Brunstetter, Kevin McCollum, Kurt Deutsch, Michael Greif, New York Stage and Film, and Vanessa Hudgens either did not respond to or declined multiple requests for comment.
For Janaya Khan, a spokesperson with Color of Change, it was an apology that fell flat. “It’s not about making them responsible,” Khan said. “It’s about what can we do with this situation that tangibly changes the conditions that informed these ideas to begin with. You can’t do that if you ignore that they exist in the first place.”",0

Former Army Contractor Sentenced To 30 Months In Federal Prison For Bribery Scheme Involving Contracts At Aberdeen Proving Ground
Baltimore, Maryland -- United States District Judge George L. Russell III sentenced Matthew Barrow, age 45, of Toledo, Ohio, today to 30 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, on bribery charges related to contracting at the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), in Harford County, Maryland. Co-defendants John Kays, age 45, of Pinehurst, North Carolina (formerly of Bel Air, Maryland), and his wife, Danielle Kays, age 44, are currently serving federal prison sentences of six years and 18 months in prison, respectively, for their roles in the scheme. The court previously issued an order that the defendants forfeit $1,487,135.52, as well as vehicles and a boat.
The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Robert E. Craig, Jr. of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service - Mid-Atlantic Field Office; Special Agent in Charge L. Scott Moreland, Mid-Atlantic Fraud Field Office, Major Procurement Fraud Unit, U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command; and Acting Special Agent in Charge Jennifer L. Moore of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office.
According to court documents, John Kays, Danielle Kays, and Barrow all graduated together from the United States Military Academy at West Point. In 2008, John Kays and Danielle Kays held leadership positions as civilian employees in the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM), representing the Army in multi-year contracts. CECOM was headquartered at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Barrow worked for a glass manufacturer in Toledo, OH. Barrow formed a company called MJ-6, to which John Kays admitted that he steered CECOM subcontracts in exchange for money.
According to Barrow's plea agreement, in March 2006, the U.S. Army Contracting Command at APG awarded a 10-year, $19.2 billion contract to seven prime contractors to provide technology services to support the integrated engineering, business operations, and logistics needs for the Army. Former Army officials John and Danielle Kays each had leadership positions related to this contract. From September 2006 through April 2011, a series of task orders for services pursuant to the contract were placed.
According to the plea agreements, from August 2008 to June 2014, John Kays agreed to take official actions favorable to Barrow and MJ-6 in return for Barrow paying them a total of approximately $800,000. Danielle Kays has admitted using her official position to benefit Barrow and MJ-6 during the period from 2011to 2014. Specifically, the Kayses used their official positions to add MJ-6 as a subcontractor acceptable to the Army, steer potential employees for government contractors to work for MJ-6, approve MJ-6 employees to work on various Task Orders, and approve the pay rates, status reports, and travel reimbursements for MJ-6 employees. Total contracts steered to MJ-6 by the Kayses exceeded $21 million.
In order to conceal his corrupt relationship with the Kayses, Barrow caused the glass company he worked for to enter into contracts and make payments to Transportation Logistics Services, LLC, a company incorporated by John Kays, until the glass company fired Barrow. Barrow then made payments to the Kayses in cash, which Barrow withdrew from his personal accounts and from MJ-6 accounts. To conceal the scheme, John and Danielle Kays made false statements on the government ethics forms that they were required to file by failing to disclose the cash payments received from Barrow. The Kayses used the cash for their personal benefit, including payments for home renovations, two new automobiles, a powerboat, jewelry, a pool party at their country club, and credit card bills.
Barrow later agreed to pay the Kayses the proceeds of the scheme from MJ-6 disguised as employment salary.
United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the DCIS, Army Criminal Investigation Command, and FBI for their work in the investigation. Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Joyce K. McDonald and Harry M. Gruber, who prosecuted the case.

products go,United States : Treasury Further Targets Entities and Vessels Moving Venezuelan Oil to Cuba,"The U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated four entities that operate in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13850.  Additionally, OFAC identified four vessels that transport oil and other petroleum products from Venezuela to Cuba as blocked property owned or controlled by the four designated entities.   The United States continues to take strong action against the former illegitimate Maduro regime and the malign foreign actors who support it. Maduros Cuban benefactors provide a lifeline to the regime and enable its repressive security and intelligence apparatus, said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Venezuelas oil belongs to the Venezuelan people, and should not be used as a bargaining tool to prop up dictators and prolong the usurpation of Venezuelan democracy.   Since the January 28, 2019 designation of Venezuelas state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), Cubametales, the Cuban state-run oil import and export company, and other Cuba-based entities have continued to circumvent sanctions by receiving oil shipments from Venezuela.  On July 3, 2019, OFAC designated Cubametales for operating in the oil sector of the Venezuelan economy pursuant to E.O. 13850, as amended.   Todays action further targets Venezuelas oil sector and the mechanisms used to transport oil to Maduros Cuban benefactors, who continue to provide a lifeline to the illegitimate former regime: Caroil Transport Marine Ltd. is based in Cyprus, and operates three vessels: Carlota C, Sandino, and Petion.  Carlota C (IMO 9502453) is a chemical/products tanker that recently delivered Venezuelan petroleum products, including gasoline, to Cuba.  In August 2019, PdVSA, Cubametales, and Cuban officials arranged to ship gasoline from El Palito, Venezuela to Cuba.  Later in August, Carlota C traveled from Venezuela to the Havana Port Petroleum Refinery in Cuba.  Sandino (IMO 9441178) is a chemical/products tanker that recently delivered Venezuelan oil products to Cuba.  Petion (IMO 9295098) is a products tanker that loaded crude oil as part of a shipment involving Cubametales and PDVSA in late May 2019.  Trocana World Inc. is based in Panama and is the registered owner of Petion.  Tovase Development Corp is based in Panama and is the registered owner of Sandino.  Bluelane Overseas SA is based in Panama and is the registered owner of Giralt.  Giralt (IMO 9259692) is a crude oil tanker that recently delivered Venezuelan oil to Cuba.   As a result of todays action, all property and interests in property of these entities, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by the designated entities, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.  OFACs regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked or designated persons.",0

into the wild s.a.,"Charges of corruption, racism in Texas referees' association [Trends (Middle East)]","Corruption and racism exist at the highest levels of the Texas Association of Sports Officials, according to a lawsuit filed by TASO member Joe Machol and his attorneys Kathleen A. OConnor and Bruse Loyd.
Machol says the alleged corruption is the reason he was banned from officiating high school football games and removed from the position of game day assistant and clock operator for the NFL and the Texans, a position he held since the franchises inception in 2002. Despite zero complaints about his performance, Machol says, he was let go by the league after the 2018 season.
Machol has a long history in officiating, including working the game clock for Super Bowls XXXVIII and LI, two NFC Championship Games, two NFC divisional playoff games and five NFL wild-card games. He also has extensive officiating experience in college football, namely with Conference USA from 2000-09, and the high school game.
Machol said his career was taken away once he began questioning TASOs financial picture. Machol ran for Houston football chapter president against incumbent Mike Atkinson in November 2017 on the platform that TASO wasnt doing enough concerning off-the-field matters such as its general fund, which is made up of members $60 annual dues.
With some 1,000 members, twice the number from a decade ago, the Houston chapter of TASO has a yearly operating budget of $100,000, according to former executive secretary Tommy Moore. Machol said TASO hadnt had an external audit in six decades at the time of the election and still hasnt to this day.
Machol won that 2017 election by one vote, taking office on Jan. 1, 2018. But he was removed by July.
Before I even did anything, they conspired to get rid of me, Machol said.
In his lawsuit, Machol claims to have discovered a meeting after his election involving Atkinson, Houston chapter treasurer Geoff Marolda, TASO state executive director Mike Fitch and state assistant executive director Bill Theodore.
Atkinson is alleged to have used the N-word in the meeting, referring to black officials as southside n------ who voted for Machol, who is white.
Fitch told the Chronicle he does not recall the use of such language by Atkinson. Atkinson said he never used that phrase as specifically alleged in the lawsuit, but he admits he has used the N-word in referring to fellow officials.
Machols attorneys were given tapes of Atkinson using the N-word on multiple occasions in phone conversations with another official. Atkinson said he was goaded and baited into using it by the official who made the recordings.
Soon after his election, Machol discovered Marolda, who has since been suspended by TASO, had transferred $3,800 from the organizations general fund into a personal account. A TASO investigation resulted in a five-year suspension for Marolda.
Machol also alleges in his lawsuit that another Houston chapter board member was involved in financial improprieties involving tens of thousands of dollars, but that matter remains unproved.
Moore said Machols reckless disparaging of TASO members with accusations and his refusal to operate under the chapters rules, bylaws and procedures is what led to his ouster.
Machols lawyers said his being a whistle blower led to manufactured ethics charges from TASO, which resulted in his subsequent removal from officiating, regardless of level.
One of the ethics charges brought against Machol was that he failed to inform the TASO board that the $3,800 was put back into the general fund by Marolda. Machol, however, says that money was never replaced.
Theres rampant racism. Theres rampant theft and fraud at the highest levels of TASO, with the attitude of I can do whatever I want even though we have policies and procedures, Machol said.
Machol believes his NFL ouster is connected to another Houston chapter board member, who last year was brought on as an alternate NFL game clock operator behind Machol.
The federal lawsuit asserts that after Machol reported to the NFL an alleged fraud committed by that board member, Moore contacted his friend, Walt Anderson, a full-time NFL referee and engaged the Good Ole Boy network to get Machol removed as a game clock operator.
Moore adamantly says that never happened and that he has no idea why the NFL removed Machol.
Machol informed the state board of the racist comments by Atkinson on Feb. 18. Two weeks later, on March 6, NFL officiating special projects coordinator Frank Szczepanik informed Machol that he was terminated.
Ive been told, after 17 years, after every single game, I did an excellent job, Machol said. Every single one. And this year they let me go because Im a whistle-blower.
Machol said his punishment for not adhering to TASO bylaws is also excessive. He has been suspended from refereeing for one year and put on probation for five more. In addition, he cannot run for or hold any TASO office for at least 10 years.
He was expelled for nonsense, pure nonsense, said OConnor, Machols attorney. And what ended up happening was the financial crimes that he raised at both the chapter level and the state level bore out to be true.
Joe was specifically targeted. All he did was take on the establishment.
There have been many sleepless nights for Machol, who is 57. He says other TASO members and referees have distanced themselves from him, not wanting to face similar consequences.
Machol believes his officiating career is over.
Theyve taken whats my livelihood. They took away my NFL; they took away my college, Machol said. They took away my high school, and they damaged my reputation. Theres almost no way to repair this. It took a lifetime to build, and its going to take a lifetime to try to rebuild.",0

elsevier b.v.,"Reports Outline Surgery Study Findings from University of Jordan (Bronchial erosion and migration of Port-A-Cath, a case report) - Surgery","2019 JUL 23 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Stem Cell Daily -- Fresh data on Surgery are presented in a new report. According to news originating from Amman, Jordan, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, “Several possible complications are known to be related to central venous catheters. A 20-year-old lady had a catheter (Port-a-Cath) inserted in the left subclavian vein to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma.”
Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Jordan, “One year after insertion, on receiving intravenous chemotherapy the patient began coughing. Imaging studies showed the tip of the catheter to be crossing the superior mediastinum into the upper lobe of the right lung. The patient was taken to the operating room and the Port-a-Cath catheter was removed intact. Migration is a rare complication associated with insertion of these lines. Accompanying erosion into an airway is even rarer.”
According to the news editors, the research concluded: “Any unexplained deterioration in the respiratory system should raise suspicion of catheter migration and bronchial erosion.”

la couture,"Chanel Loses Double ""C"" Trademark Infringement Case In China","The 110-year old couture house has lost a trademark infringement case it brought against a Chinese jewelry store that was selling goods brandishing a similar logo to the iconic Chanel double ""C"" logo.
The Chinese court held that the jewelry shop owner did not infringe Chanel's trademark rights for the following reasons.  For one, the double ""C"" that formed the shape of the pieces of jewelry sold at the jewelry shop did not act as a trademark - despite Chanel's exclusive rights to use of its registered trademark for the double ""C"" pattern.  The court also held that the shop owner did not mislead buyers into thinking that they were purchasing Chanel products.  In fact, the court stated that the ordinary consumer with a general level of understanding would not deem that they were purchasing Chanel products.
The decision of the court has aroused widespread concern in the industry.  The court's decision seems to deny the possibility of transforming a 2-D trademark (i.e. Chanel's registered trademark for the double ""C"" pattern) into a 3-D product as a type of trademark infringement.
The good news for Canadian brand owners is that there were sweeping changes to our trademark laws that came into effect on June 17, 2019.  As part of those changes, the definition of a trademark was expanded to cover anything that functions as an indicator of source, including 3-D shapes.  We can help you in maximizing your brand protection.

plan 02,Academic Official Voices Concern about Iranian Scientist's Situation in US Jail | Academic Official Voices Concern about Iranian Scientist's Situation in US Jail [FARS News Agency] | Iran/United States: Iranian Scientist Kept Behind Bars for Rejecting Cooperation with US,"TEHRAN (FNA)- President of Tarbiat Modares University in Iran Mohammad Taqi Ahmadi expressed deep concern about the dire situation of renowned Iranian stem cell scientist Professor Massoud Soleimani who has been jailed in the US without any charge for nearly one year. ""We are concerned about the health conditions of Massoud Soleimani. Dr. Soleimani is not in a desirable conditions in jail and all academics, even in the US, condemn his detention,"" Ahmadi told reporters in Tehran on Wednesday.He added that Soleimani is being kept in a detention center which also hosts dangerous criminals.Also, Rasoul Soleimani, the brother of Dr. Soleimani, said on Wednesday that the Iranian scientist's health conditions has deteriorated and he has lost over 15kg of his weight.""He has not access to his main medicine yet,"" he added, warning that his brother is in danger.In relevant remarks on Monday, Iranian Minister of Science, Research and Technology Mansour Gholami rapped the US for prolonging detention of professor Soleimani, describing it as a move out of mere animosity towards Iran.""The Americans have held the Iranian scientist in detention out of hostility and without any proof and reason and they should free the prominent professor immediately,"" Gholami told FNA.He noted that the US administration should have allowed Soleimani to enjoy his full legal rights since he was put under arrest, but it never did, ""and it, hence, is duty-bound to compensate for the different moral and physical harms inflicted on the Iranian scientist"".In relevant remarks on Saturday, Rasoul Soleimani said that he has likely been imprisoned for rejecting cooperation in a highly important research project for the US several years ago, and is under pressure to cooperate with the United States.""Some 7 years ago, he traveled to California for a research project, and there he received some charming offers, but turned them down,"" he said.""As far as I know him, he will not accept cooperation with the US even if he is kept in prison for a lifetime,"" he added.Rasoul complained that the US has jailed his brother for over 11 months without holding a court session and without any evidence against him.Earlier this month, Rasoul Soleimani had blasted the US for violating human rights and prolonged detention of his brother without any proof, and said Massoud is not even aware of his mother's death who went into a 6-month coma after hearing about her son's situation.""When professor Soleimani was jailed in the US, we did not inform our mother and father but unfortunately on March 15, one of our relatives told her about Dr. Soleimani's situation accidentally and she had a stroke after 24 hours, was in coma for nearly 6 months and passed away earlier this week,"" Rasoul told FNA at the time.He said that Dr. Soleimani is not aware of his mother's death, adding that when he heard that his mother was in coma he was in a very poor mental status.Rasoul noted that his brother has lost 15kg of his weight due to the bad quality of food in the US jail.He described the US as a disloyal government, saying that they persuaded Dr. Soleimani to visit the US to cooperate in a project and then they arrested him.Soleimani has been imprisoned by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) without trial since October 07, 2018.Back in October, Soleimani, a professor and biomedical researcher at the Tarbiat Modares University (TMU) in Tehran, was arrested by the FBI upon his arrival in the US.According to his Atlanta attorney, Leonard Franco, he has since been held behind bars in a jail in Atlanta without bond.Soleimani had been invited by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for leading a research program there, but he was secretly indicted by the FBI, which also canceled his research visa. Neither the FBI nor the US prosecutors have so far officially commented on his detention. BJay Pak, the US attorney in Atlanta, secured Soleimani’s indictment on June 12, 2018, just a month after President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Iran nuclear deal, and Soleimani had been fully unaware of such an indictment when he flew to the US.Franco and Page Pate, another Atlanta lawyer, said that they had been puzzled by the federal government’s decision to prosecute a renowned Iranian professor and two of his former students - Mahboobe Ghaedi and Maryam Jazayeri - for purported trade sanction violations over eight vials of human growth hormone.Franco said that Soleimani’s treatment by federal authorities, the revocation of his visa and the decision to detain him without bond doesn’t square with Soleimani’s international reputation as a scholar, professor, and doctor widely known in the field of stem cell research and regenerative medicine. Soleimani has no criminal history anywhere in the world, he added.The hormone, which is a form of synthetic protein, was seized from Jazayeri in 2016 by customs authorities in Atlanta when she was heading to Iran to give it to professor Soleimani for research purposes. Jazayeri had received the hormone from Ghaedi.The seizure occurred at a time when Washington was still a signatory to the 2015 nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and anti-Iran sanctions had not been re-imposed yet.The growth hormone is not banned in the US or Iran and was being used “exclusively for medical research”, which is still considered largely exempt from US sanctions, Franco said.However, Ghaedi and Jazayeri faced similar federal charges for attempting to supply Soleimani with the growth hormone.Ghaedi is a permanent American resident and an assistant professor at Yale University's School of Medicine. She is free on a $250,000 bond. Jazayeri is a naturalized US citizen and Kentucky resident and has conducted medical research at the University of Louisville. She is currently free on a $200,000 bond.“I truly don’t understand it,” Franco said of the government’s decision to prosecute, adding that it appeared to be “some type of policy argument”. Pate, who represents Jazayeri, said his client was “completely confused by all this.”Motions to dismiss the charges are pending in federal court in Atlanta in front of US District Judge Eleanor Ross. However, Federal prosecutors in Atlanta have not yet responded to the motions.Hearing this case has been adjourned for at least three times since October and his family and the TMU have so far paid $70,000 to his lawyers to prove his innocence, but all to no avail, said TMU’s Vice-chancellor for Research Affairs Yaghoub Fathollahi.Fathollahi added that Soleimani is a distinguished professor who has been ranked among the top 1% scientists in the world.Almost 50 Iranian nationals are currently imprisoned in the United States under various pretexts, mainly bypassing the US sanctions. Even American citizens working for Iranian entities are not immune from US government’s hostile policies.Back in January, the FBI took Muslim journalist Marzieh Hashemi, who works for Iran’s English-language Press TV television, from St. Louis Lambert International Airport to a detention center in Washington DC without placing any charges against her, forcing her to eat pork and remove her Islamic hijab.",0
fairmont federal credit,Woman sentenced in fraud case,"Aug. 8--FAIRMONT -- A 24-year-old Pontiac, Mich. woman entered a guilty plea recently in Marion County Court in a fraud case dating back to April 28, 2015 in Marion County.
Marion County Prosecutor Jeffrey Freeman said Jamya Abrams pleaded guilty to two counts of forgery as part of a plea agreement before Marion County Judge David R. Janes.
She received sentences of two terms of no less than 1 or more than 10 years in a state penitentiary, to be served consecutively, but those sentences were suspended and she was placed on probation for three years, according to Freeman. He said supervision of the probation may be transferred to her home state of Michigan.
""She asked to remain in West Virginia until both the interstate compact on the transfer of supervision is completed,"" he said. ""Both states basically have to approve.""
Freeman explained the crimes to which Abrams pleaded guilty.
""She and others had found some way to print authentic-looking business checks and made them payable to Jamya Abrams, presented them to two separate banks in Marion County, W.Va.,"" he said. He said one was Fairmont Federal Credit Union and the other was BCBank.
""The fictitious checks were purportedly from BB&T,"" he said.
However, Freeman noted, ""the company did not have an account at BB&T, and the checks were  not authentic, but were printed somehow by computer.""
According to a previously published Times West Virginian article, a detective with the Fairmont Police Department said Abrams used two fraudulent checks that drew $1,721.06 from Freedom Home Medical LLC, a Morgantown business. The detective said he spoke with the business owner who told him he had never heard of Abrams and didn't authorize the checks.
Freeman said Abrams made it look as if she were an employee or a client of the business getting a refund.
He said a charge of fraudulent scheme charge, a charge of conspiring with other people and two uttering charges were dismissed.
Freeman said a warrant was served on Abrams after she was located in Detroit, and she was brought back to Marion County.

2m lighting inc,A Settlement Agreement May Prevent Infringement And Validity Challenges In Subsequent Litigation,"Abstract
A “No Challenge Clause” in a settlement agreement can be used to preclude a party from bringing specific affirmative defenses in an infringement claim.
Background
Kenall Manufacturing sued Cooper Lighting for infringing a patent related to modular lighting fixtures, eventually settling the case and entering into a license agreement. Kenall waived its claims for past infringement and granted Cooper a nonexclusive license to the patent and any patents stemming from the original patent. Cooper also agreed to label its products with a patent notice, to pay Kenall a one-time fee, to make quarterly royalty payments based on sales of the infringing products, and to redesign one of its products to avoid infringement.
The license included a “No Challenge Clause” that stated: “Cooper does not admit infringement, validity or enforceability of the Subject Patents, and reserves all defense to any [related] allegation of infringement, . . . however, Cooper shall refrain from contesting the validity, enforceability, or infringement of the Subject Patents in any court of law or other forum unless Kenall asserts the Subject Patents against Cooper products other than the Subject Products.”
Kenall's relevant patent family eventually grew to five patents: the original patent, two continuations, and two reissued patents. Kenall notified Cooper in 2015 that since the beginning of 2008, (1) Cooper had not made royalty payments, (2) Cooper had not labeled its products per the License, and (3) Cooper had not redesigned one of its products per the Agreement. 
Ultimately, in 2017, Kenall sued Cooper for infringing the five patents and breaching the settlement and license agreement. In response, Cooper asserted that the patents were not infringed and were invalid. Kenall then moved to strike these defenses based on the parties' prior agreement.
Kenall's Motion to Strike Cooper's Patent Defenses
The court found that the No Challenge Clause precluded Cooper from alleging affirmative defenses of noninfringement, invalidity, and intervening rights against the patents subject to the settlement agreement and license. In analyzing the No Challenge Clause, the court noted an apparent incongruity. The clause states that Cooper admits no infringement or invalidity and that Cooper reserves all defenses to infringement. The clause then states, however, that Cooper shall refrain from contesting validity, enforceability, or infringement.
To resolve the apparent conflict in the language, the court held that infringement can broadly mean a cause of action that a patent owner might bring. Or, infringement can narrowly mean an element of an infringement claim requiring that one or more of a patent's claims cover an accused product. The court interpreted the first use of “infringement” narrowly: Cooper does not admit that the Subject Products are covered by the Subject Patents. The court interpreted the second use of “infringement,” however, broadly: Cooper reserves the right to defend itself against Kenall in an infringement suit. The court interpreted the third use of “infringement” narrowly and as an exclusion to the second term: Cooper may defend itself in an infringement litigation, but it may not bring specific defenses of validity, enforceability, or infringement. The court held that this meant that Cooper cannot argue that the Subject Products are not covered by the Subject Patents, generally known as a defense of noninfringement. According to the court, Cooper contracted to not bring a defense of noninfringement in an infringement suit that asserted the Subject Patents against the Subject Products.
Strategy and Conclusion
A No Challenge Clause can be used in a litigation settlement agreement to preclude a defendant's use of affirmative defenses including invalidity and noninfringement. This case shows that the wording of such a clause can matter and be subject to differing interpretations.

fortune 7 inc,Facebook’s co-founder: ‘It’s time to break up Facebook’,"Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, is calling for the breakup of the social media juggernaut, citing the threat of the platform's unchecked power and that of its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
         In an op-ed published Thursday in the New York Times, Hughes joined the growing chorus of lawmakers and advocates demanding the U.S. government rein in Facebook. Despite its myriad scandals — Russian propagandists exploiting the platform to spread misinformation and sway U.S. elections, the sharing of millions of users' personal data with the political data firm Cambridge Analytica and companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix — Facebook's reach continues to grow.
         ""For too long, lawmakers have marveled at Facebook's explosive growth and overlooked their responsibility to ensure Americans are protected and markets are competitive,"" Hughes wrote. ""It is time to break up Facebook.""
         Facebook rejected this argument in a statement Thursday afternoon, suggesting that regulation of the Internet — as Zuckerberg called for in a March op-ed published in The Post — was the only thing that would bring real accountability.
         ""Facebook accepts that with success comes accountability. But you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,"" Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement. ""Accountability of tech companies can only be achieved through the painstaking introduction of new rules for the Internet.""
         Hughes's calls come as Facebook faces yet another controversy:  An investigation by the Associated Press revealed that the platform automatically generates videos and pages that elevate extremist groups.
         The op-ed painted a stark portrait of Facebook's dominance: The company is worth a half-trillion dollars and its products are regularly used by billions of people. By Hughes's estimates, Facebook commands ""more than 80 percent of the world's social networking revenue.""
         Hughes and Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook with Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz in 2004 while they were enrolled at Harvard University, an origin story famously chronicled in the Oscar-winning film, ""The Social Network."" All are now billionaires save Hughes, whose fortune has been estimated at $430 million.
         Another major social networking platform hasn't been founded since 2011, and despite movements like #deleteFacebook, it's almost impossible to avoid, with many people eschewing the core platform in favor of Instagram or WhatsApp, not realizing they are Facebook subsidiaries. The apparent avalanche of disasters hasn't dented Facebook's finances; its earnings per share increased 40 percent last year.
         ""Because Facebook so dominates social networking, it faces no market-based accountability,"" Hughes wrote. ""This means that every time Facebook messes up, we repeat an exhausting pattern: first outrage, then disappointment, and finally, resignation.""
         No aspect of Facebook is more troubling than Zuckerberg's total authority, Hughes wrote, calling it ""unprecedented and un-American."" Zuckerberg controls 60 percent of the company's voting shares and has ultimate oversight over Facebook's algorithms, its privacy settings and community guidelines. He has the money and power to copy, buy, or squash his competitors. Though Hughes defended Zuckerberg as a ""good, kind person,"" he cast him as a man hellbent on domination.
         ""I'm angry that his focus on growth led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks,"" Hughes wrote.
         Facebook's monopoly is stifling innovation and economic growth, Hughes argued, citing the 20th century breakups of Standard Oil and AT&T by the Department of Justice as examples of effective government intervention. The shift toward business-friendly policies in the ensuing years has eroded antitrust enforcement, Hughes wrote, at the expense of entrepreneurship, productivity and consumer health.
         Hughes wants the government to correct the Federal Trade Commission's ""biggest mistake"" by forcing Instagram and WhatsApp to split from Facebook and become competitors once again. He also wants the government to create an agency to monitor tech companies and ensure healthy regulation. Zuckerberg himself has publicly invited regulation, but Hughes maintains Zuckerberg is interested only in regulation that is ""friendly"" to Facebook's interests.
         
         ""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,"" Zuckerberg wrote in his op-ed. He also cited privacy, data protection and election integrity as other areas in need of government oversight.
         Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made a case for federal intervention with Facebook. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has made the breakup of American tech giants a pillar of her presidential campaign.
         ""Today's big tech companies have too much power — over our economy, our society & our democracy,"" Warren said in a tweet Thursday. ""They've bulldozed competition, used our private info for profit, hurt small businesses & stifled innovation.""
         
         Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has said he'd hit tech companies with antitrust violations or fraud charges, arguing they unfairly censor right-leaning speech. This week, two top senators urged the FTC to go beyond its expected $5 billion fine against Facebook for its privacy practices, calling for tough punishments and accountability measures.
         ""The public is rightly asking whether Facebook is too big to be held accountable,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wrote in a letter to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons. ""The FTC must set a resounding precedent that is heard by Facebook and any other tech company that disregards the law in a rapacious quest for growth.""",0
mattel inc,Google's YouTube To Pay $170 Million Penalty For Collecting Data On Kids | Google's YouTube to pay $170 million penalty for collecting data on kids [Jerusalem Post (Israel)] | Google's YouTube to pay $170 million penalty for collecting data on kids,"Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.
The settlement with the FTC and the New York attorney general's office, which will receive $34 million, is the largest since a law banning collecting information about children under age 13 came into effect in 1998. The law was revised in 2013 to include 'cookies,' used to track a person's internet viewing habits.
YouTube had been accused of tracking viewers of children's channels using cookies without parental consent and using those cookies to deliver millions of dollars in targeted advertisements to those viewers. Google declined to comment when this settlement leaked last week.
YouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube.
In its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that 'YouTube is today's leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,' according to the complaint.
'YouTube touted its popularity with children to prospective corporate clients,' FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement. 'Yet when it came to complying with (federal law banning collecting data on children), the company refused to acknowledge that portions of its platform were clearly directed to kids.'
New York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies 'abused their power.'
'Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,' said New York Attorney General Letitia James.
In addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to refrain from violating the law in the future and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children.",0

i c federal credit union,"James E. Doyle senteced to 2 years in prison for scamming close to $500,000 from banks","PROVIDENCE  2019--PROVIDENCE -- A federal judge on Friday sentenced former state Sen. James E. Doyle II to two years in prison for scamming close to $500,000 from banks by passing tens of thousands of worthless checks over four years.
U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith gave Doyle to 24 months for passing some $74 million in bogus checks between 20 accounts in three banks in a check-kiting scheme. On a single day in February 2016, as the scheme was about to collapse, he deposited 31 worthless checks totaling $300,000.
Doyle, a former Democratic lawmaker from Pawtucket, pleaded guilty in September to 31 counts of bank fraud and one count each of filing a false tax return and failing to file taxes in 2016.
""Every time a public official comes through this court ... the trust of the people have in our government... is chipped away,"" Smith said.
Doyle family members erupted in sobs as the sentence was delivered.
Federal prosecutors in August accused Doyle of defrauding about $5000,000 from three banks -- Bristol County Savings Bank, Alliance Blackstone Valley Federal Credit Union and Santander Bank -- in a scheme that entailed writing checks from one bank account, despite not having enough money, and then depositing them at another bank and withdrawing funds.
In addition, authorities alleged that he and his wife failed to report more than $1 million in income from 2013 to 2016, amounting to $305,000 in taxes. He was also charged with failing to file taxes in 2016, despite earning $255,000 in income.
Doyle, the son of the late, longtime Pawtucket Mayor James Doyle, resigned as a state senator Jan. 9, 2018, citing ongoing problems with alcohol. He was first elected to represent Senate District 8 in 2004.
In April, Democrat Sandra C. Cano won a special election to fill Doyle's former seat.",0
h.l. auto i/s,"State Farm, Allstate Sue Doctors and Pain-Management Clinics, Alleging Billing Fraud","Two insurance carriers filed separate lawsuits recently againstmedical doctors and their pain-management clinics, accusing them ofsubmitting bills for unnecessary medical procedures performed onvehicle-accident victims.
State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. filed suit in the U.S.District Court for Southern Texas against Dr. Nooruddin S. Punjwanias well as the clinic where he practiced, Pain Alleviation &Interventional Needs (PAIN), as well as the owners of the clinic.It is seeking $3 million in damages.

Allstate Insurance Co. filed a racketeering lawsuit in the U.S.District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against ThePain Center USA, Interventional Pain Center and Dr.s RajendraBothra and Erick Backos, seeking $860,000 in damages. The carrierin February filed a similar lawsuit against several other clinics,seeking $3.5 million.
State Farm alleges that Punjwani performs epidural steroidinjections for nearly all patients he sees at his Baytown, Texaspractice without performing legitimate medical examinations. Hereviewed magnetic resonance imaging scans and documented conditionsthat did not exist or exaggerated the severity of existingconditions, the suit says.
State Farm said PAIN charges $1,500 for the use of fluoroscopicguidance with the injections, but could not produce anyfluoroscopic images when asked.Punjwani charged $8,000 for eachepidural steroid injection and $500 for an examination in additionto the fluoroscopic charge, the carrier said.
The clinic billed State Farm for 810 epidural steroid injectionsout of 821 patients examined. All of them sere diagnosed withspondylosis and stenosis, according to the suit.
Defendants Barketali M. Roopani and his sons, Anil B. and SohailB. Roopani, are laymen owners of the PAIN clinic, the suit says.State Farm alleges that they shared in the proceeds from thefraudulent scheme.
Allstate's April 22 suit against The Pain Center USA and theother Detroit-area clinics is the latest of several racketeeringlawsuits that it has filed against medical providers for allegedlytaking advantage of the state's no fault auto-insurance law.
The carrier says Bothra controlled and operated The Pain CenterUSA and Interventional Pain Center, both in Warren, Michigan.Backos ""participated in the control"" of both clinics, according tothe suit.
While Bothra has claimed that the Pain Center treats onlypatients with chronic pain who have not been helped throughconservative treatment, many patients started treatment therewithin days of their alleged motor vehicle accidents, the suitsays.
Once the patients arrived, The Pain Center and InterventionalPain performed bilateral procedures that are normally performed onthe say day into two separate dates ""to multiply the amount of feescharged.""The carrier charges that the doctors prescribed patientsopioids as an inducement for them to return to the practice,knowing full well that they were contributing the nation's opioidaddiction crisis. Those opioid prescriptions led to urine drugscreening, which could also be billed to insurance carriers, thesuit says.
Allstate says Bothra found a way to expand his billings in March2016, when he opened the Interventional Pain Center's ambulatorysurgery center. The surgery center billed Allstate for facilityfees for dates of service more than three months before it opened,according to the suit. The clinics billed for blood tests that werenot performed, urine drug tests that weren't performed, physicaltherapy that wasn't performed and injections that were never given,the suit says.
Backos wrote out disability certificates for the ""overwhelmingmajority"" of patients who he treated at the clinics.
""The defendants' goal in treating patients was to perform asmuch treatment as possible, regardless of whether such treatmentwas reasonably necessary to the patients' care, recovery, orrehabilitation, and/or arose out of an alleged motor vehicleaccident, in order to generate bills to Allstate,"" the suitsays.
Allstate in February filed a similar lawsuit against severalother pain clinics. The defendants are Michigan Pain Management,Dearborn Pain Specialists, Southfield Pain Management, SterlingHeights Pain Management, Precision MRI of Michigan, AdvancedSurgery Center, North Shore Injury Center, and Medi Transit. Thelawsuit also names as defendants three chiropractors, fourphysicians and three other people. Allstate is seeking $3.5 millionin damages.

denko a/s,Patent Term Extension In Different Countries,"ABSTRACT
A patent is a legal document granted by the government giving an inventor the exclusive rights to make, use and sell the invention for specified number of years with usual term of 20 years. This term can be extended by following both constitutional and conventional laws which are either implied or expressly provides for the same and when applied, prolongs the term of the patent (mostly 5 years). For better comprehension and appreciation of Patent Term Extension (PTE), Patent Linkage System is also e discussed to the point necessary in the article.
Patent linkage is the establishment of relationship between the market approval process of generic drugs and the patent status of the originator product. So this system does not allow grant of marketing approval of any third party prior to expiration of patent term unless consented by the patent owner. Hence this concept/system is very essential for the generic manufacturer to prove the drug regulator that the drug, for which he seeks approval, is not covered by a validpatent. While Patent Linkage system doesn't find mention in TRIPS Agreement but is dealt in TRIPS - plus agreement to which India is not a signatory. Also Patent term extensions are contained in statutes of respective countries. They are also open to patent term adjustments and corrections too. This being said, the current article discusses about patent term extension in different countries, their procedures and their necessities.
PATENT TERM EXTENSION
COUNTRIES WITHOUT PTE LAWS
Countries such as Brazil, Mexico, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, etc. lack the laws relating to patent term extension whereby term of patent comes to an end by the end of 20 years even if the regulatory authorities delay approval of drugs covered in patent in all possible ways.
COUNTRIES WITH PTE LAWS
While countries like United States, European Union, Japan, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and many more are known to have a sound system of patent term extension and also contain rules regarding amendments. A brief view of how patent term extension works in these countries along with comparative study of the system in United States & European Union is further dealt herein.
1. ISRAEL
Extension of term of patent is allowed in cases involving medicinal compositions and medical devices. Proprietors of basic patent and exclusive license holders are entitled to file an application for PTE and that an application for a PTE must be filed within 60 days from the grant of marketing approval from Ministry of Health.
To file a PTE application, regulations specified in ANNEX A must be strictly adhered to: (1) Filing of an application for PTE (2) Official letter by the Patent Officeacknowledging the application and the filing date thereof (3) once the provisions of the Law are met, PTE application to be published with the intention of issuing an Extension Order (the Notice) (4) Filing an opposition within 3 months from publication of the Notice, if not the Extension Order will issue.
PTE shall expire on the earlier of the following dates: (1) 5 years from the expiry of the ""basic patent"" (2) 14 years from the first date of obtaining marketing approval in the ""Convention country"" (3) Expiry date of the Extension Order in the ""Convention Country"" (4) Date of cancellation of the Israeli marketing approval (5) Date of cancellation or amendment of the ""basic patent"" (6) On the dates that renewals were due and were not paid.
A petition for a PTE must be submitted no later than 90 days from the date of regulatory approval of the drug. Originally, the deadline to file a petition for PTE was extendable in 'appropriate circumstances'. Most of the extensions that were granted were quite short (extensions of a few days). Attempts to obtain longer extensions were consistently denied. However, in the Lundbeck decision, the Patent Office extended the deadline for filing a PTE petition by 19 months. In the decision, the Patent Office accepted the patentee's arguments that it was not informed by its local patent agents of the PTE provisions in Israel.
2. JAPAN
In Japan, the patent term extension for 5 years is available for pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. But Japan lacks provision for any additional extension period (e.g., 6 month paediatric extension in the EU.). An application for extension of term must be filed within three months of the first regulatory approval of the product. Notably, in Japan subsequent approval for the same active ingredient for a second indication may serve as a basis for an additional extension.
Japan is the only country that has a minimum time of patent term extension i.e. 2 years and a request for extension of the term has been put forth by Japan Pharmaceutical Industry Association to abrogate the 2 year period. The application for PTE cannot be filed with the Patent Office at anytime after 6 months prior to expiration of patent rights in Japan.
3. SINGAPORE
The Patents (Amendment) Act 2004 introduced patent term extensions to take into account delays in obtaining marketing approval for pharmaceutical products which are equivalent toSupplementary Protection Certificates (SPC) issued forpharmaceutical patents in Europe.The regulating legislative framework encompasses Sections 1, 36A, Schedule of Singapore Patents Act and Rule 51A of Singapore Patents Rules. The minimum to maximum period of patent term extension is from 'a period equivalent to the interval between the date of issue of the certificate of grant and the date marketing approval was obtained' to 'a period of five years'.
An application for PTE must be made to the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) on Patents Form 54 with a fee currently of S$950. Patents Form 54 requires the Applicant to state the period of the extension of the patent term it seeks whereby Applicant needs to submit a certificate from the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore.
An application for a patent term extension needs to be made within 6 months from the date of grant of the patent and the date of marketing approval was obtained. If thepatent is still in force, an applicationcannot be made after 6 months from the normal 20 year term of the patent.
4. AUSTRALIA
For an Australian patent to be eligible for patent term extension, the claims of the patent must contain either a pharmaceutical substance per-se, or the one produced by a process involving use of recombinant DNA technology. A pharmaceutical substance is defined as a compound, an active metabolite, a composition or a mixture of substances.
Requirements for obtaining PTE: to include pharmaceutical substance in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, at least 5 years between filing of patent application and date of first marketing approval, application to be made within 6 months of grant of patent and from first regulatory approval date. Therefore, the maximum period of the patent term extension is 5 years.
5. RUSSIA
The patent term extension is applicable to the whole of Confederation of Russia.The patent term extension procedure was first introduced in Russia in 2003. Inaccordance with Russian legislation, which regulated patent term extension procedure until 2015, a patent directed at a medicine, pesticide or agrochemical was extended in respect of the claims covering the product. In October 2014 amendments were made to the Civil Code, wherein the amendments introduced the procedure of grant of asupplementary patent restricted to the marketed product. New patent term extension regulations were put into force on 8 January 2016. But the usual time period of patent term extension is 5 years.
6. UKRAINE
The term of a patent related to drugs - for protecting humans, animals and plants, may be extended at the request of the owner for a period not more than 5 years. Ukraine provides an opportunity to extend the period for a medicinal /agrochemical product patents. In December 2018, the Cabinet approved a draft law to bring Ukrainian IP legislation in line with the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. Under the draft law, patent protection will not be granted to diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for treating of humans or animals and to newer forms of known medicinal products. Also, the law held that the period of supplementary protection should be equal to the period between the application date and the date of the first authorization by a competent authority, not exceeding a total of five years.
7. TAIWAN
The patent term extension practice was introduced in 1994 via Patent Act Amendments (PAAs). Only the 2011 PAAs involve the patent term extension practice. A term extension can be sought for a pharmaceutical or an agrochemical-related patent under the condition that the first market approval for practicing said patent is not secured until two years after patent publication (""two-year limitation""). The two-year limitation was removed by the 2011 Patent Act Amendments.
Requirements for patent term extension are - critical filing date, applicable patents, entitled applicants, deadlines for applying for patent term extension, first market approval and its determination and those legally related to the market approval shall be adhered to. Finally, the IPO shall publish the written application in the Patent Gazette if all the formal requirements are fulfilled by the application seeking patent term extension.

8. UNITED STATES
Various events can delay the application maturing into patent. When delays are caused by Patent and Trademark Office, the time lost can be regained through Patent Term Adjustments. Similarly PTE is a compensation given for delay caused for getting drug approval from FDA to market it. PTE doctrine has its genesis in section 35 U.S.C § 156 of Hatch-Waxman Act 1984. Under this Act, PTE is available to patents covering human drug products, veterinary products and medical devices. While both PTO and FDA participate in calculating PTE, the PTO has the final say.

The maximum term of extension is 5 years. Any term extension granted under the statute is applied from the original expiration date of the patent, including any PTA. In USA, a patent is eligible for extension of term only if it includes - 1)at least one claim covering the approved drug product 2) patent not expired 3) patent never been extended 4) to submit a complete and timely application for extension.
9. EUROPEAN UNION
In member countries, a supplementary protection certificate (SPC) is a sui generis extension of a patent available to medicinal and plant protection products. These SPCs were introduced to handle the time lost by way of granting a regulatory approval. The certificate is generally issued only where the product is a medicinal one. For availing SPC following conditions shall be fulfilled - that the product be protected by basic patent, a medicinal product to be given market authorization, product is not previously the subject of a certificate. SPCs come into effect at the expiry of national or European patent. However European Patent Convention (EPC) is modified to allow 'extension' to the European patent. In accord, Article 63 of EPC was modified in 1991.

10. INDIA
The debate over the patent term extension has its basis in the delay in examining and prosecution of patent applications, granting regulatory approvals. Such delays are more so in cases of pharmaceutical invention where the product is not marketed for several years for want of timely regulatory approval.The proposal for the patent term extension was first mooted in the Second Committee appointed by Government of India on the direction of Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the Nitto Denko case - to mainly consider PTE for the time lost in processing of the application. The committee concluded that 20 years patent term (which was originally 7 years/14 years) provided for delays and nothingprevents the applicant/inventor from taking steps for regulatory approvals and commercialization, while the patent application is pending.
With all being said, the future of patent term extension (PTE) in India still seems gloomy as the course of jurisprudence doesn't seem to affirm it.
CONCLUSION
Either Patent Term Extension or Supplementary Protection Certificate, their purpose is the same - extend the protective period of patent which is usually 5 years. Observation makes it clear that United States, European Union and Confederation of Russia and a few other countries have the luxury of exercising the PTE/SPC provision. The only shortcoming is to follow all the procedures as worded in the respective statutes. But most of the Southeast-Asian countries (Indonesia, Thailand, India, Hong Kong, china etc) including some American countries (Brazil, Mexico etc) lack such a provision.

research data inc,Research misconduct claim upheld against former head of UCL lab,"A lab run by one of Britain’s foremost academics published fraudulent scientific papers for more than a decade, according to investigators.
Work at Prof David Latchman’s laboratory at UCL Institute of Child Health came under scrutiny from senior academics after an anonymous whistleblower alleged that dozens of papers from the lab were doctored.
Latchman, a prominent geneticist with hundreds of papers to his name, oversaw research by about two dozen scientists at the laboratory from the early 1990s until 2003 when he became master of Birkbeck, University of London.
UCL initially refused to release the reports from two separate misconduct investigations in 2014 and 2015 but finally made them public on Monday. The Guardian had requested the documents under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in January and, after a lengthy delay, referred the case to the Information Commissioner’s Office.
The reports show that experts convened by UCL found evidence of research fraud in each of the investigations and called for the doctored papers to be retracted. One panel said fabricated data it had spotted “might be just the tip of the iceberg” and said work in many other papers was “very sloppy”. The studies covered a range of topics from human genetics to heart attacks.
While the reports did not claim that Latchman fabricated data himself or had any knowledge of the behaviour, an allegation of research misconduct against him was upheld. “Whilst he did not intentionally commit the misconduct in research identified in this investigation, his recklessness in the conduct of his laboratory and his involvement as author on many publications facilitated that misconduct,” one panel found.
The first expert panel checked 28 papers from Latchman’s lab dating back to 1997 and found evidence for research misconduct in eight of them. The second panel examined 32 studies from 1990 to 2013 and found evidence of fraud in seven.
One paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology contained clear evidence of “cloning”, where copy and paste was used to repeat features throughout an image. In some papers, fabrications were “fundamental” to the conclusions reached by the authors.
“In the panel’s view the evidence clearly indicates that the researchers in the laboratory had developed a culture outside the accepted standards of research integrity,” one panel found.
Latchman’s department has so far retracted at least six papers and corrected two more. One retracted study contained an old image that was dressed up as new data. In a second retraction, six images had been flipped or copied and relabelled to make them look new.
A co-author of the second paper, Anastasis Stephanou, who is now at the European University in Cyprus, admitted responsibility for the latter manipulations and said Latchman and the paper’s other authors were “completely unaware” of the changes.
Further questions have been raised over dozens of studies from Latchman’s group on the PubPeer website, a forum used by academics to discuss scientific research.
UCL said: “These reports concluded that manipulation of research data had occurred in many research papers during the period of Prof David Latchman’s time as head of the unit.”
As a result, it said, UCL started formal disciplinary action against a former member of Latchman’s research group, who it did not identify, but the individual resigned before it was completed. Because Latchman had not intended to commit misconduct in research, there were insufficient grounds for dismissal, the statement added. Latchman no longer supervises research.
A disciplinary hearing in September 2018 chaired by a UCL chemist, Prof Richard Catlow, decided that no formal action would be taken against Latchman. Instead it noted that fraud could be hard to detect and recommended UCL “consider the difficulties in leading a research unit” when the head could spend only a small proportion of their time overseeing research. It also urged senior group leaders to consider when they should stop being named authors on papers.
A spokesman for Latchman said: “The outcome of this UCL disciplinary hearing has drawn a protracted four-year long ordeal involving publications at UCL to a close. The nature of the manipulation identified in the UCL investigation was such that any fraud would only be apparent to a reviewer who was actively looking for such deception. To subject all research to this disproportionate scrutiny is not reasonable. To then make the assertion that to overlook such deception is ‘inattentive’ or ‘reckless’ is unjust.
“Thankfully, UCL have recognised that scientific fraud can be difficult to detect, even in well-run teams, and as such made the decision that no disciplinary action would be taken against Prof Latchman. UCL also recognised that there is a clear need in the training of early-career scientists to instil the highest standards of research ethics, while making clear the consequences of fraudulent behaviour, a sentiment that Prof Latchman has always supported.”
Latchman received a CBE in the 2010 birthday honours for services to higher education. As a member of the National DNA Database Ethics Group, he advises Home Office ministers on the ethical use of DNA samples.",0
s.j.m. limited,SAT sets aside SEBI order barring PricewaterhouseCoopers firms for alleged role in Satyam fraud,"The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has set aside a 2018 order of the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barring the operation of accounting firms under the PricewaterhouseCoopers aegis.The order was passed by a Bench of Presiding Officer Justice Tarun Agarwala and Member Dr. CKG Nair.In January 2018, SEBI had barred global accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and its network entities from issuing audit certificates to any listed company in India for two years.The regulator had also asked PwC to pay Rs 13.09 crore, along with interest at 12% per annum from January 2009 (approximately Rs 14 crore) for wrongful gains. Two former PwC partners - S Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri - were also barred from issuing audit certificates to listed companies for three years.The 2018 SEBI order stems from the Satyam scandal of January 2009. The order came nine years after the scam at Satyam Computer Services Limited (SCSL) came to light and after two failed attempts by PwC to settle the case through the consent mechanism. On January 7, 2009, Chairman of Satyam Software Services Ramalinga Raju confessed to a Rs. 7,136 crore fraud committed by him and a few others at the company.In February 2009, SEBI had issued show cause notices to the PricewaterhouseCoopers firms directing them to show cause as to why directions under Section 11, 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act should not be issued for violation of provisions of the SEBI Act and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003.Subsequently, petitions were moved before the Bombay High Court in 2010, challenging the jurisdiction of the SEBI to issue show cause notices against the firms. However, the High Court had dismissed the petitions, stating that the jurisdiction of SEBI would depend upon the evidence gathered during the investigation and that only if there was some omission without any mens rea or connivance with anyone would the SEBI be barred from issuing any further directions.Further, as per the directions of the Bombay High Court, the scope of inquiry was restricted only to the charge of conspiracy and involvement in the fraud and not to any charge of professional negligence.In the challenge before the SAT, the petitioners contended that the order is manifestly erroneous in law and that the directions issued by the Bombay High Court were totally disregarded.On the aspect of mens rea on the part of the accounting firms, the SAT held,""Thus, pinning down the engagement partners and the audit firms on a preponderance of probabilities that they had committed a big fraud in a reckless and careless manner cannot in our view lead to a conclusion that there was any intention or mens rea on their part. The High Court was very clear and categorical that SEBI could only proceed under the SEBI laws only if there was a specific finding of mens rea against the engagement partners and / or the audit firm.""While allowing the appeals filed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the SAT Bench observed that not even a whisper of evidence of collusion by auditors was on record. Stating that the audit firms had no role to play in the Satyam fraud, the Tribunal stated that banning them was not justified. The order states,""There is no evidence to indicate that the ten firms had any role to play in the audit of SCSL. These ten firms had nothing to do with the audit of SCSL. They had no knowledge of the day to day affairs of SCSL either directly or indirectly. There is not even a whisper of a finding in the impugned order against the ten firms about any connivance or collusion or intention or knowledge on their part in the audit of SCSL.""The SAT went on to hold,""We find that there is no direct evidence to show that the engagement partners/audit firms/other PW firms were directly involved in the fabrication of the books of account of SCSL. In fact, the Chairman of SCSL has gone on record in so many words that the statutory auditors were kept in the dark and that they had no role to play in the fudging of the books of account.""On the issue of liability of auditors, the SAT held,""In our view, action against a Chartered Accountant can be taken only in terms of Chartered Accountants Act, 1949. SEBI cannot in the garb of proving conspiracy and connivance on the part of the Chartered Accountant interpret the auditing standard on a standalone basis. The auditing standards can only be related to the professionalism of a Chartered Accountant vis-a-vis its professional misconduct which can only be considered by the ICAI.""Thus, the SAT quashed the order of the SEBI barring the accounting firms and the two partners from auditing listed companies.Zerick Dastur Advocates and Solicitors represented PricewaterhouseCoopers before SAT in the appeal filed against the SEBI order. Senior Counsel Mukul Rohatgi, Janak Dwarkadas, and Shyam Mehta, along with Advocates Somasekhar Sundaresan and Zerick Dastur appeared for the PwC accounting firms. Solicitor Berjis Desai also advised the firms.Argus Partners represented the partners of PricewaterhouseCoopers K Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri through a team led by Senior Partner R Sudhinder along with Managing Associate Prerana Amitabh and Associate Vatsala Pant. Senior Advocates Gaurav Joshi and Mustafa Doctor appeared for the partners.Senior Counsel Ravi Kadam and Kevic Setalvad appeared for SEBI. They were briefed by K Ashar & Co.",0
fasten b.v.,Sacramento paid $2.8M in settlements in 2018. See why and who got paid,"April 07--     Apr. 7--The city of Sacramento paid about $2.8 million to settle 24 lawsuits in 2018, including four that alleged police officers used excessive force.
The city said in a statement Wednesday it spent a great deal of time and effort on the lawsuits.
""The City of Sacramento places a high value on fairness and fiscal prudence and remains committed to responding to all complaints with a thorough investigation and vigorous litigation when necessary,"" the statement said.
Police
--  The city paid $40,000 to Aaron Namoca, who alleged officers Johnny Lopez and David DeLeon beat him during a traffic stop in 2016.
Namoca and a friend were walking to be picked up by an Uber driver in south Sacramento when two officers pulled up and accused Namoca of tampering with a mailbox, the lawsuit, filed in federal court in 2016, alleged.
When Namoca denied the accusation, an officer punched him multiple times near his head, neck and upper body, dislocating his shoulder and giving him a black eye, the lawsuit alleged. When a lieutenant arrived, Namoca and his friend were released.
The injuries caused Namoca to miss two weeks of work, which caused him to be laid off, the lawsuit alleged.
Lopez and DeLeon no longer work for the city. The lawsuit also named former police chief Samuel Somers Jr. and current Deputy Chief of Police David Peletta as defendants.
--  Namoca, Arlie Halcomb and Nicolette Jones were detained by city police during separate incidents, but no accusatory pleadings were filed against them. However, their criminal records did not note the incidents were just detentions, according to a class action lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court in 2016. The city agreed to change that practice, to edit the records for all people detained from 2015 to present from ""arrested/cited"" to ""detained,"" and agreed to pay $30,000 to the attorney for the case.
-- The city paid $550,000 to Nandi Cain Jr., who was beaten by an officer in 2017 after jaywalking. As part of the settlement, police also agreed to changes in police procedures, including a random audit process for body camera footage the city must make public, as well as tracking and reporting of jaywalking citations.
-- The city paid $25,000 to Kuwese Coreyelle Walker, who alleged officers injured him while arresting him in December 2013. Walker was walking from a hotel to Discovery Park when three officers approached him with their firearms drawn, the federal lawsuit, filed in 2015, alleged. The officers cut Walker's hands with handcuffs, hit his head while putting him in a squad car, failed to fasten his seat belt, then injured him when they struck a concrete pillar on the way in to the police garage of the Sacramento County jail, the lawsuit alleged.
Sexual harassment
The city paid a woman $27,500 after she alleged her boss sexually harassed her, and that she was denied a permanent position with the city after she reported it.
The woman was hired as a limited-term system support specialist in the city's utilities department in December 2013. Shortly after she was hired, supervisor Elsie Fong started sexually harassing her, the federal lawsuit, filed in 2016, alleged.
On multiple occasions, Fong fondled herself while talking to the woman, showed her panties and asked her bra size, the lawsuit alleged.
The woman was not hired as a permanent employee because she complained about Fong and because Michael Malone, who was the city's operations and maintenance manager at the time, was friends with Fong, the lawsuit alleged. Fong, Malone and the woman no longer work for the city.
Racial and disability discrimination/retaliation
--  The city paid $860,000 to Maryann Canelli, who alleged the city wrongfully terminated her because of an injury in 2016. Canelli, who worked as a program analyst in the city's human resources department for four years, suffered a workplace injury in 2015 that required her to file for workers' compensation benefits, a lawsuit filed in 2017 in Sacramento Superior Court alleged. After several months, the city placed Canelli on a mandatory leave of absence, then terminated her for alleged misconduct, the lawsuit alleged.
--  The city paid $100,000 to Timothy Metcalf, a former employee in the city's waste division, who said he was discriminated against because of his race and age. Division supervisors Steven Harriman, Enrique Hernandez, and William Skinner created a hostile work environment by racially harassing acts that began in 2013, a lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court in 2013 alleged. Metcalf, Harriman, and Skinner no longer work for the city. Hernandez is an integrated waste general supervisor in the Public Works Department.
--  The city paid $2,500 to Darrin Hall, a city employee who alleged his bosses discriminated against him because of his race and age. Hall, who works as a waste equipment operator for the city's public works department, alleged he was overlooked for promotions because he is black and because he is over the age of 40, the lawsuit, filed in Sacramento Superior Court in 2013, alleged. The lawsuit named Harriman, Skinner and Hernandez as defendants.
Struck by city vehicles
The city paid a total of $640,000 to eight people who alleged they were struck by city vehicles. The city also paid $10,000 to a couple who were hit by a light rail train.
Other
-- The city paid $240,573 to 108 current and former police and fire employees who alleged in a federal 2016 lawsuit they never received overtime pay.
-- The city paid $15,000 to a minor who alleged he was beaten by an after-school teacher at Brennan Middle School. Sacramento City Unified School District is also named as a defendant in the 2015 lawsuit filed in Sacramento Superior Court.
-- The city paid $90,000 to G&G Concrete, a city contractor, related to a Civil Wage and Penalty Assessment issued by the California Department of Labor Standards Enforcement.
--  The city paid $90,000 to Anna Knott, who alleged she was injured when she tripped on a pothole near Willie's Burgers on 16th Street.
--  The city paid $25,000 to Dianne Pinney, who alleged she was injured when she tripped on a steel beam sticking out of the sidewalk near 16th and R streets.
--  The city paid $23,000 to Sharon Wright, who alleged a water main flood in 2011 damaged merchandise at Carol's Books on Del Paso Boulevard, and that merchandise was moved to a location she could not access.
--  The city paid $65,000 to SimplexGrinnel LP over an alleged breach of contract for fire alarm replacement at the Pannell Center in Meadowview.

m a aps,APS admits to spending $10.7M on 2014 election | Report: APS spent $10M to elect regulators in 2014,"PHOENIX - The state's largest electric utility admitted late Friday it spent $10.7 million in 2014 to elect two regulators of its choosing.
In a formal filing with the Arizona Corporation Commission, Barbara Lockwood, a vice president of Arizona Public Service, said nothing in state law requires her company to divulge the information.
And APS and its parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., have fought prior subpoenas demanding that same data, including filing suit.
But Lockwood said the company has ""hope of putting the past behind us.""
Lockwood would not comment.
That, however, is not the whole story.
APS and Pinnacle West for years fought efforts by Bob Burns to force disclosure. And they won in court when a judge said that Burns, by himself, had only limited authority to issue and enforce subpoenas.
All that changed, however, with the election this past November of Democrat Sandra Kennedy. And Republican Boyd Dunn, who was not elected until 2016, agreed to seek the information.
That gave the trio a working majority on this issue on the five-member panel. And it raised the likelihood that the commissioners could force the company to give up the documents.
The size of the spending admission surprised Burns.
Up until now, the only thing that was known was that two groups - the Arizona Free Enterprise Club and Save Our Future Now - had together reported spending $3.2 million to secure the election of Republicans Tom Forese and Doug Little.
But they refused to disclose the source of their dollars, citing their status as ""social welfare"" organizations which exempts them from some of the campaign finance laws that apply to others.
And until Friday APS would neither confirm nor deny that any of that cash came from the utility or its parent.
Friday's filing shows that Pinnacle West gave nearly $5.9 million to the Free Enterprise Club in 2014. And it funneled another $3.5 million into Save Our Future Now, money the company says went to the commission race.
That, however, is not all of it. The company reports giving nearly $1.4 million to the Arizona Cattle Feeders Association, money that a company spokeswoman said also was spent on the commission race.
Separately, Pinnacle West revealed it made political donations to other organizations in the 2014 campaign. That includes $50,000 to the Republican Governor's Association which helped the first election of Gov. Doug Ducey, and $425,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association which in turn bought commercials to elect Republican Mark Brnovich.
That $10.7 million number surprised some of the regulators.
""Wow!"" said Andy Tobin.
""That takes me by surprise.""
Tobin said the disclosure - coming years after the election - underlines his desire to force regulated utilities to be more transparent with the money they are spending.
Since the 2014 race Pinnacle West has agreed to disclose what it gives to others who are spending money on campaigns. But that disclosure does not come until early the following year, after the election.
Burns said he would like to explore whether regulated utilities could be barred from spending money to elect their own regulators.
On one hand, he said, corporations do have the right to participate in the political process.
But he also pointed out that the commission has the authority to determine what is a reasonable rate of return on their investment.
And he said that Friday's filing, which also disclosed what the company has been spending on lobbying, marketing, advertising and charitable contributions, could provide a basis for regulators to determine if the company is earning too much.
Little left the commission in 2017 to take a job in the Trump administration in the Department of Energy. Forese lost his reelection bid last year.",0

For the reasons set forth below, theCourt concludes that execution on the amended judgment is no longerstayed, and the Court therefore grants the motion to that extent. OnMarch 14, 2017, the Court issued a judgment in favor of plaintiffagainst defendants in the amount of $139,800,000.00 plus postjudgmentinterest and costs. Defendants then moved under Rule 62 for an orderstaying execution on the judgment and approving a proposed bond, and onMarch 28, 2017, the Court issued such an order in the form proposed bydefendants. Plaintiff had notified the Court that it did not oppose themotion, and it had notified defendants that it approved the form of theproposed bond. On May 30, 2017, after awarding prejudgment interest, theCourt issued an amended judgment nunc pro tunc in favor of plaintiffagainst defendants in the amount of $145,983,548.00 Case2:11-cv-02686-JWL Document 521 Filed 08/02/19 Page 1 of 7 2 pluspostjudgment interest and costs.1 Defendants appealed, but the FederalCircuit affirmed the rulings of this Court, issued its judgment on March18, 2019, and issued its mandate on April 24, 2019. Defendants havesought and received an extension of time from the Supreme Court to filea petition for writ of certiorari to review the decision of the FederalCircuit. By its present motion, plaintiff essentially seeks leave topursue execution on the amended judgment. Plaintiff argues that the stayordered by the Court terminated once the Federal Circuit issued itsmandate, and it notes that defendants have not requested a stay ofenforcement of the mandate from the Federal Circuit or the Supreme Courtunder Fed. R. App. P 41(d) or 28 U.S.C. SS 2101(f). Defendants argue inresponse that this Court's original stay order remains in effectpending proceedings in the Supreme Court on defendants' certioraripetition. Plaintiff does not dispute that the Court's stay order,by its terms, covers the time of an appeal to the Supreme Court.Defendants' motion requested a stay during ""the pendency ofall appeals,"" the Court ordered a stay ""throughout thependency of . . . all appeals,"" and the bond approved by the Courtstates that it was given to obtain a stay pending resolution of anyappeal to the Federal Circuit ""and/or the United States SupremeCourt."" The issue thus becomes whether the Court had the power tostay execution on the judgment after an affirmance and mandate from theFederal Circuit during the pendency of a certiorari petition or appealto the Supreme Court. 1 Plaintiff does not dispute that thepreviously-ordered stay also applied to the amended judgment. Case2:11-cv-02686-JWL Document 521 Filed 08/02/19 Page 2 of 7 3 The Courtbegins by noting that 28 U.S.C. SS 2101(f) gives it no such power. Thatstatute provides that if a judgment is subject to review of the SupremeCourt or writ of certiorari, a stay of the execution and enforcement ofsuch judgment may be granted either by a judge of the court renderingthe judgment or by a justice of the Supreme Court. See id. The statuteelsewhere imposes a deadline for certiorari petitions or appeals to theSupreme Court from the date of the judgment appealed from, see id. SS2101(c); thus, the ""judgment"" referenced in Section 2101(f)would be the Federal Circuit's judgment in this case. Accordingly,a stay under this statute could only be granted by the Federal Circuitor the Supreme Court, and not by this Court. Indeed, courts haveconsistently ruled that Section 2101(f) does not grant a district courtauthority to issue a stay pending appeal to the Supreme Court. See,e.g., In re Stumes, 681 F.2d 524, 525 (8th Cir. 1982); United States v.Sample, 2018 WL 6622198, at *2 (D.N.M. Dec. 18, 2018) (citing cases).Defendants do not dispute this interpretation, and they insist that theyrely not on Section 2101(f), but rather on Fed. R. Civ. P. 62, whichthey invoked in first seeking the stay in this Court. At the time of theCourt's initial stay order, Rule 62 provided that a district courtcould stay execution and enforcement of a judgment pending dispositionof certain motions, and that ""[i]f an appeal is taken, theappellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond,"" with the staytaking effect when the court approves the bond. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(b), (d) (2017). Courts in this district and elsewhere have interpretedthat rule as allowing a district court to issue a stay only duringappeal up to the time of the circuit court's mandate, and notduring the pendency of a petition to the Supreme Court for writ Case2:11-cv-02686-JWL Document 521 Filed 08/02/19 Page 3 of 7 4 ofcertiorari. See, e.g., Brinkman v. Department of Corrections of State ofKan., 857 F. Supp. 775, 776-77 (D. Kan. 1994); Ventas, Inc. v. HCP,Inc., 2011 WL 3678819, at *1-2 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 22, 2011) (federal courtshave reached a consensus in ruling that district courts lackjurisdiction to stay execution of an appellate court judgment); WilliamA. Graham Co. v. Haughey, 794 F. Supp. 2d 566, 567-69 (E.D. Pa. 2011);Gander v. FMC Corp., 733 F. Supp. 1346, 1347 (E.D. Mo. 1990). The Courtis persuaded that those courts' interpretation is correct. Rule 62allows a district court to stay execution of its judgment during anappeal, but once the court of appeals has issued its mandate, thatappeal of the district court judgment has concluded. Any subsequentappeal to the Supreme Court is of the judgment of the court of appeals,not the judgment of the district court, and Rule 62 does not authorize adistrict court to stay the appellate court's judgment. Rather, thatpower has been given to the appellate courts and the Supreme Court in 28U.S.C. SS 2101(f) and Fed. R. App. P. 41(d). As the Haughey courtstated, ""[i]t is simply not the proper role of a district court todecide whether a judgment of a higher court should be stayed pendingpossible review by the Supreme Court."" See Haughey, 794 F. Supp. 2dat 569. Defendants argue that plaintiff has failed to cite a caseinvolving a district court stay order that applied by its terms to aSupreme Court appeal. The fact that the Court's previous stay ordercovered an appeal to the Supreme Court is irrelevant, however, as theCourt had no power to issue such a stay. The courts in the cited casesconcluded that district courts do not have such power, and this Courtagrees that its power is so limited. Case 2:11-cv-02686-JWL Document 521Filed 08/02/19 Page 4 of 7 5 Defendants have not cited any case in whicha court interpreted Rule 62 to authorize a district court to issue sucha stay.2 Defendants rely on the present version of Rule 62, whichprovides as follows: At any time after judgment is entered, a party mayobtain a stay by providing a bond or other security. The stay takeseffect when the court approves the bond or other security, and remainsin effect for the time specified in the bond or other security. See Fed.R. Civ. P. 62(b) (2018). Defendants argue that because their bondspecified a duration that included an appeal to the Supreme Court, therule allows for a stay of that duration. That language concerning theduration of the stay was included in 2018 amendments to the rule,however, and thus was not in effect in 2017 when the Court issued itsstay order.3 Moreover, even under the present version of the rule, thisCourt still lacks authority to issue a stay beyond the time of theFederal Circuit's mandate. The rule still authorizes a stay of adistrict court's judgment, but as discussed above, defendantsactually seek a stay of the judgment issued by the Federal Circuit inthis case. Indeed, with respect to the language concerning the durationof the stay, the comments accompanying the 2018 amendments note that thecompletion of the appeal occurs when the mandate issues, and furthernote that the rule ""does not supersede the opportunity for a stayunder 28 U.S.C. SS 21(f) pending review by the Supreme Court oncertiorari."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 62(b), 2018 2 In arguing thatplaintiff should be held to its initial agreement to the requested stay,defendants cite FHFA v. Nomura Holding America, Inc., 2018 WL 3315528(S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2018). In that case, the bond contemplated a stayduring any appeal to the Supreme Court; however, the court did notaddress the issue of its authority to issue a stay under Rule 62 thatwould extend beyond the appellate court mandate. See id. 3 Defendantsmistakenly stated that the rule was so amended in 2009. Case2:11-cv-02686-JWL Document 521 Filed 08/02/19 Page 5 of 7 6 adv. cmtee.notes. Thus, the 2018 amendment does not grant a district court power tostay the judgment of a higher court. Finally, defendants argue thatplaintiff should be held to its consent to a stay lasting throughout anappeal to the Supreme Court. The Court is sympathetic, as plaintiff hasnot explained why it is now choosing not to honor its previous agreementto forgo execution during an appeal to the Supreme Court.4 As discussedabove, however, the Court simply lacks the power to issue any staylasting beyond the appellate court mandate, and defendants have notcited any authority suggesting that a party's consent may overcomethat lack of authority. Accordingly, the Court agrees with plaintiffthat the previously-issued stay of the execution and enforcement of theamended judgment has now terminated with the Federal Circuit'sissuance of its mandate and judgment. The Court thus orders that thestay is dissolved, and it grants plaintiff's motion to that extent.IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED BY THE COURT THAT execution on the amendedjudgment is no longer stayed, and plaintiff's motion for an orderenforcing the amended judgment is therefore granted to that extent. 4Plaintiff argues that it did not agree to such a stay, but ratherdeclined to oppose defendants' stay motion; however, plaintiffeffectively agreed that plaintiff could obtain the relief it requestedin that motion, and it also affirmatively approved the form and languageof the proposed bond that referenced a stay lasting through a SupremeCourt appeal.

energy coal s.p.a.,"State DEQ says recent Belews Creek filing isn't troubling
N.C. DEQ says recent Belews Creek contaminated groundwater filing is not troubling | North Carolina DEQ says recent Belews Creek filing is not troubling | State DEQ says recent Belews Creek filing is not troubling","The agency has not taken additional action against Duke Energy for recent groundwater ""exceedances.""
State environmental officials say they are not surprised by Duke Energy's recent reports of contaminated groundwater near coal ash pits at the Belews Creek Steam Station and three other coal-fired plants in North Carolina.
Slight increases in chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and beryllium in groundwater drawn right beside utility waste ponds are not cause for alarm, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Quality said.
""The exceedances reported are not unexpected, especially since these sample results are collected from wells located adjacent to the waste boundary of a coal ash impoundment, which is near the source material,"" said Sarah Young of the DEQ's Raleigh office.
Young's comment came in answer to the Greensboro News & Record's request for the agency's perspective on recent assertions by the Southern Environmental Law Center in Chapel Hill that the new disclosures showed that ""more toxic substances are polluting the water at Duke Energy coal ash sites across North Carolina.""
The environmental group made the statement after Duke Energy posted public acknowledgements that groundwater testing showed higher trace levels of certain chemicals around ash ponds at Belews Creek Steam Station and at plants near Roxboro, Lumberton and Lake Norman.
At Belews Creek in Stokes County northwest of Greensboro, the company reported such an ""exceedance"" of federal groundwater standards for mercury. It had previously reported similar groundwater overages there for arsenic, beryllium, cobalt, lithium and two forms of radium.
Such public acknowledgements are required under federal law whenever groundwater testing near a coal ash pond shows that a chemical contaminant has increased above a safety threshold administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Young said the data Duke Energy reported most recently was ""generally consistent"" with what the utility has been submitting under a state law that is stricter overall than the federal ""Coal Combustion Residuals"" rule that triggered the company's filings.
Duke Energy is governed by both the EPA's federal standards and the state Coal Ash Management Act, Young said, adding that North Carolina's so-called CAMA requirements are ""typically more stringent"" than corresponding federal guidelines.
Southern Environmental Law Center lawyer Frank Holleman said that the environmental group had not overreacted to the federal filings by Duke Energy, noting that these standards were ""put in place to require notification of the extent of pollution of the environment by coal ash pits across the country.""
""The rule sets national standards and testing requirements, apart from requirements set by the states,"" the senior SELC attorney said Wednesday. ""These recent required filings inform the public that additional toxic groundwater pollution has entered the environment from these Duke Energy sites.""
But Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton depicted the situation as emblematic of a ""concerted effort by environmental groups to mislead the public.""
""They consistently omit the fact that the impact shown in these CCR reports is to groundwater right under or beside our ash basins, as they're well aware,"" Norton said, using the acronym for the federal ""Coal Combustion Residuals"" program.
Extensive testing of groundwater, lakes and streams by a variety of experts has shown repeatedly that ""drinking and recreational water supplies remain safe from coal ash impacts,"" Norton said.
The state coal ash law requires Duke Energy to safely close by 2030 all of its coal ash storage basins at Belews Creek and 13 other current or former coal-fired plants statewide. That includes cleaning up the groundwater.
Over the years, the utility has amassed millions of tons of coal ash submerged in basins throughout North Carolina. The basins were developed in the days when coal-fired power was in vogue and initially were seen as a safe way to sequester a pollutant that was more of an airborne threat to human health.
State lawmakers adopted the Coal Ash Management Act in the aftermath of a major coal ash spill from a storage basin at the retired Dan River Steam Station near Eden in February 2014.
The relationship between state DEQ and Duke Energy is one of regulator to supervised industry. The agency's duties include overseeing the utility as it gathers scientific evidence and begins closing out its ash basins at 14 sites in North Carolina.

Missing MP 'still alive'
A Libyan TV channel has reported that Seham (Siham) Sergewa, an MP who disappeared after being confronted by armed individuals earlier this month, is still alive.
Libya's 218TV reported yesterday that it had received ""reliable information from an informed source"" suggesting that she was alive and that negotiations to secure her release were ongoing.
Sergewa's husband and son were shot during her disappearance on 17 July, according to local media.
MP Seham Sergewa had reportedly made comments critical of the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) shortly before her disappearance, privately owned Al-Wasat news website and Twitter users have indicated.Reports of oil closure
Local media have cited reports of the closure of Libya's key Sharara oil field.
The story was covered by local outlets, including the Al-Wasat, 218TV and Libya Observer websites, but all relied on reporting from Reuters news agency for their coverage. Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) has not commented.
According to Reuters, a valve on the pipeline between the oil field and Zawiya oil terminal in the west of the country has been closed.
The pipeline reopened just last week but production has been repeatedly disrupted.
In February this year, the oilfield was closed by protesters demanding greater development in southern Libya, backed by armed guards from the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG), who had been tasked with securing the oil field in the troubled region.
Revenues dropped by 21 per cent for that month, the NOC later announced.Pro-GNA force issues video on LNA links to Sudan
The Tripoli-based Operation Volcano of Anger, which is fighting in support of the UN-brokered Government of National Accord (GNA), has posted a video on alleged links between the eastern-based army and Sudanese militia fighters.
The video, entitled ""What is the relationship between Haftar, Hemeti and Mossad"", was viewed around 3,800 times within 14 hours of being posted on Facebook on 30 July.
Using foreign media reports, it examined reported links between Libyan National Army (LNA) head Khalifa Haftar and the Sudanese Janjaweed through a Canadian consultancy firm led by ""former Mossad officer"" Ari Ben-Menashe.
The video suggested that Haftar would use Sudanese forces in his offensive against the capital Tripoli.

penelope sa,"Former French PM Fillon, his wife to face trial over fake jobs: report","PARIS, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his wife would face trial over fake job allegations that made the Republican Party's contender lose his status as the favourite in the 2017 presidential election, state-run radio reported on Tuesday.
   France info radio, citing a source close to the affair, said financial investigating judges had ordered to send Fillon and his spouse, Penelope Fillon, to trial on charges of misusing public funds, conspiracy and failing to fully disclose their financial situation to the High Authority for Transparency of Public Life.
   Fillon's ex-deputy Marc Joulaud would also face trial over embezzlement of public funds, the report added.
   The so called ""PenelopeGate"" emerged at the end of January 2017 when a local satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported that Fillon had paid his wife and two of his children about one million euros (1.125 million U.S. dollars) for their jobs as parliamentary assistants. However, there was no evidence indicating that they had really worked.
   Once a favorite to win the contest to the Elysee Palace, the 65-year-old conservative was forced to quit the presidential race due to the alleged wrongdoings which he had repeatedly denied, denouncing ""judicial bias"" in investigation. (1 euro = 1.125 U.S. dollars) Enditem",0
rps s.p.a.,Supreme Court stays Amtek Auto liquidation,"The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT)'s decision ordering liquidation of debt-ridden Amtek Auto. A bench led by Justice Arun Mishra - while seeking responses from UK-based Liberty House Group PTE, Deccan Value Investor LP, resolution professional Dinkar Venkatsubramanian and ex-promoter Arvind Dham - stayed the liquidation of Amtek Auto, which was among the first list of the 12 companies that were referred by the Reserve Bank of India for initiation of insolvency process in 2017.
Liberty House was selected as the highest bidder by Amtek Auto's committee of creditors (CoC). However, it later backed out citing some reasons, following which lenders requested for another 90 days to find a new buyer. However, the NCLAT had last month declined the CoC's request for extension of the insolvency resolution process deadline.
Challenging the August 16 liquidation order, the lenders led by Corporation Bank told the SC that the appellate tribunal had failed to uphold the tenets of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to resolve a financially viable entity. It said Amtek Auto, being a financially viable entity, was being pushed into liquidation merely on account of the fact that Liberty House, the successful resolution applicant, had defaulted in implementing the resolution plan. ""Resolution of the financial affairs of a distressed company is the primary aim of IBC and a failure/frustration of the processes on account of the conduct of a resolution applicant ought not to undermine the primary objective sought to be achieved,"" the lenders said.
""The deliberate failure to implement the RP is a fraud committed on the process carried under the Code"" and in such circumstances the NCLAT should have allowed the CoC's request to invite and evaluate fresh RPs and ensure that a financially viable entity is not liquidated, the CoC said in its appeal.
It further said ""maximisation of the value of the assets of the corporate debtor is embedded in the Code"" and, therefore, an opportunity should be given to CoC to make an attempt at resolution, especially keeping in view the availability of suitable resolution applicants in the market.
The Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of Amtek Auto was initiated on July 24, 2017 by the NCLT and lenders of the company had selected the resolution plans by two firms - Liberty House and Deccan Value, which later withdrew from the race. A revised plan of Liberty House was selected by the CoC on April 2, 2018 with 94.20 per cent votes and the same was upheld by the NCLT on July 25,2018.
However, Liberty House backed out from the race and even refused to furnish the performance guarantee and other terms and conditions which were approved.
The NCLAT on August 16 had directed the Chandigarh Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal to pass an order of liquidation as 270 days mandated under the IBC for finalising a resolution plan had already lapsed. It has given liberty to RP and CoC of Amtek Auto to move an application before the NCLT ""to decide as to whether the matter is required to be referred to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India or the central government for taking any action"".

bank of new zealand,United States : SEC Halts Alleged $125 Million Offering Fraud | SEC HALTS ALLEGED $125 M OFFERING FRAUD [U.S. Fed News] | SEC Halts Alleged $125 Million Offering Fraud | SEC Halts Alleged $125 Million Offering Fraud | SEC Halts Alleged $125 Million Offering Fraud,"The Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it has filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against three individuals and three entities in connection with an alleged fraudulent, ongoing international trading program that has placed at risk more than $125 million of investor funds.  According to the SEC's complaint, beginning in March 2016, Mediatrix Capital Inc. and its three principals, Michael S. Young, Michael S. Stewart, and Bryant E. Sewall, induced investors to invest by falsely representing that their money would be invested using a highly profitable algorithmic trading strategy that had never experienced an unprofitable month and had returned more than 1,600% since inception. In truth, the complaint alleges, the defendants' trading strategy consistently lost moneylosing more than $18 million from its trading in 2018 alone. In addition to repeatedly misrepresenting the profitability of the trading, the complaint alleges defendants also misled investors by falsifying account statements and making Ponzi-like payments, all while misappropriating more than $35 million of investor money for defendants personal use, including to purchase luxury properties and vehicles.  ""We allege that this scheme has resulted in tens of millions of dollars in investor losses, in part, to fund defendants' luxurious lifestyle,"" said Kurt L. Gottschall, Director of the SEC's Denver Regional Office. ""The SEC will do all it can to hold these defendants accountable and ensure money is returned to those who were deceived.""  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Colorado on Sept. 12, 2019, and unsealed today, charges all defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as well as with violating the registration provisions of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The SEC's complaint also charges Mediatrix Capital, Young, Stewart, and Sewall with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC has also charged 20 relief defendants who allegedly received profits from the fraud.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Jeffrey D. Felder and Tracy W. Bowen of the SEC's Denver Regional Office and supervised by Kimberly L. Frederick and Jason J. Burt. The litigation is being led by Stephen C. McKenna and Mark D.

l'oreal sa,Workers questioned over Notre-Dame inferno as donations pour in | Workers questioned over Notre-Dame inferno as donations pour in | Workers questioned over Notre-Dame inferno as donations pour in | Workers questioned over Notre-Dame inferno as donations pour in [Iran Daily],"French investigators probing the devastating blaze at Notre-Dame Cathedral Tuesday questioned workers who were renovating the monument while hundreds of millions of euros were pledged to restore the historic masterpiece.
As firefighters put out the last smouldering embers, a host of French billionaires and companies stepped forward with offers of cash worth around 700 million euros ($790 million) to remake the global landmark.
Most of the roof has been destroyed, its steeple has collapsed and an unknown number of artifacts and paintings have been lost. The main organ, which had close to 8,000 pipes, has also suffered damage.
But the cathedral's walls, bell towers and the most famous circular stained-glass windows at France's most visited tourist attraction remain intact, leading the vicar general Philippe Marsset to call it ""more than miraculous"".
""We're all just dumbfounded. It's more than miraculous, it's heroic,"" Marsset said, who paid tribute to the more than 400 firefighters who toiled through the night.
Junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told reporters at the scene that work to secure the structure would continue into Thursday, allowing firefighters access to remove remaining artifacts and artworks.
Though ""some weaknesses"" in the 850-year-old structure had been identified, overall it is ""holding up OK"", he added.
The Paris fire service said that the last remnants of the blaze were extinguished Tuesday, 15 hours after the fire broke out.
Renovation work on the steeple, where workers were replacing its lead covering, is widely suspected to have caused the inferno after the blaze broke out in an area under scaffolding.
Investigators interviewed witnesses overnight and began speaking with employees of five different construction companies that were working on the monument, said public prosecutor Remy Heitz.
""Nothing indicates this was a deliberate act,"" Heitz told reporters, adding that 50 investigators had been assigned to what he expected to be a ""long and complex"" case.
The architect in charge of the renovation project slated to last until 2022 said no workers were on the site when flames first appeared shortly before 7:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Monday.
- 'Epicentre of our life' -French President Emmanuel Macron struck a defiant tone late Monday as he visited the scene with his wife Brigitte, telling reporters: ""We will rebuild Notre-Dame because it is what the French expect.""
He described the cathedral as the ""epicentre of our life"".
A public appeal for funds drew immediate support from French billionaires and other private donors as well as from countries including Germany, Italy and Russia which offered expertise.
French billionaire Bernard Arnault and his LVMH luxury conglomerate, rival high-end designer goods group Kering, Total oil company and cosmetics giant L'Oreal each pledged 100 million euros or more.
Support came from outside France as well, with Apple chief Tim Cook announcing the tech giant would give an unspecified amount to help restore a ""precious heritage for future generations.""
Specialised craftsmen and rare materials are expected to be needed to restore Notre-Dame, which is seen as an emblem of France and, more broadly, a symbol of Western civilisation that has survived revolutions and war.
""We have everything to be able to rebuild it in exactly the same way,"" Culture Minister Franck Riester told France Inter, adding that the government was looking at ways to encourage donations.
But experts warned a full restoration will take many years. ""I'd say decades,"" said Eric Fischer, head of the foundation in charge of restoring the 1,000-year-old Strasbourg cathedral.
- Full losses unknown -Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror Monday as flames engulfed the building and rescuers tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral's treasures.
Many more came Tuesday to the banks of the river Seine to gaze at where the roof and steeple once stood.
A firefighter suffered injuries during the blaze, which at one point threatened to bring down one of the two monumental towers on the western facade of the cathedral that is visited by 13 million tourists each year.
The Holy Crown of Thorns, believed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion, was saved by firefighters, as was a sacred tunic worn by 13th-century French king Louis IX.
Rescuers formed a human chain at the site of the disaster to evacuate as many artifacts as possible, which were then stocked temporarily at the Paris town hall.
Smoke damaged paintings will be sent to the Louvre museum, a world centre for restoration.
Shock at the extent of the damage was palpable in France and stirred reactions from governments worldwide.
In a rare statement, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II said she was ""deeply saddened"", while Pope Francis hoped that Notre-Dame ""may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilisation of all, a jewel in the heart of the city.""
The cathedral has been a backdrop to the twists and turns of French history since construction began in mid-12th century -- and has featured in countless books and movies.
Bells at cathedrals across France were to ring out on Wednesday at 6:50 pm (1650 GMT) in tribute.
